# New Rules

Mercenaries Note: Faction rules do apply to mercenaries unless otherwise specified, though not if that rule specifies a Keyword a mercenary does not have.
Psychic Powers
Psychic powers are special abilities that PSYKER models have access to. They are purchased like Battlekit, and can be purchased after a model is recruited, but cannot be later sold. Each model’s statistics will tell you how many powers they can/must purchase, and from where.


In order to cast a psychic power, a model must take the Cast action, which always requires a Risky Success Roll. This roll is always considered to have the PSYCHIC Keyword, and the caster has +DICE equal to the X value of its PSYKER X Keyword.


A model can take the Cast Action multiple times during its Activation, but each time a model uses a psychic power during its Activation, it suffers a cumulative -1 DICE to all further psychic power Success Rolls, and its psychic powers have a cumulative PERILOUS ±1, made during that same Turn.


Note that some other Success Rolls, such as attacks with a Force Weapon, have the PSYCHIC Keyword, but do not count as psychic powers. They are not subject to any of the additional rules below, but PSYCHIC attacks can benefit from the PSYKER X Keyword (see that Keyword for more information).


There are two types of psychic power:


Attack. Psychic powers that provide attacks function just like weapons and have the same kind of statistics, but they use a model’s PSYCHIC X value to determine +DICE to Hit in place of Ranged Skill or Melee Skill. They do not take up any hands and special rules that specify “weapon” rather than “attack” do not apply to them. Melee psychic powers cannot normally be used as or alongside off-hand attacks. Using an attack power still counts as a normal use of Shoot or Fight in addition to Cast, and follows the same limits in addition to those for psychic powers.


Effect. An Effect psychic power applies a benefit, penalty, or other effect on a successful roll. It includes keywords, a range (Melee, X”, or No Range), what targets are allowed (Point, Self, One Ally, X Allies, One Enemy, X Enemies, No Targets, Each Model, Each Model Besides Self, etc.), and duration* (Immediate, End of Turn, Next Activation, Target Activation, End of Battle, or Special). On a successful roll, the listed effect takes place.


An Effect psychic power requires line of sight unless it has IGNORE LINE OF SIGHT.


*Duration definitions:
* Immediate: The effect takes place immediately and has no lasting effects.
* End of Turn: The effect lasts until the end of the current Turn.
* Next Activation: The effect lasts until the start of the caster’s next Activation.
* Target Activation: The effect lasts until the end of the target’s next Activation. If the power affects multiple targets, the effect ends on each individually. If the caster is a target, the effect ends on it at the end of its current Activation, typically the one it cast the power during.
* End of Battle: The effect lasts until the end of the battle.
* Special: The power describes its duration.
Deny the Witch
Whenever an enemy model uses a psychic power, before they roll, if one of your PSYKER models is within 12” of and can see that enemy, your model can attempt to cancel that psychic power. To do so, it makes a Success Roll, which has the PSYCHIC Keyword and +DICE equal to the X value of the model’s PSYKER X Keyword, then the opponent makes their normal Success Roll for the power.
* If your model’s result is equal to or higher than the opponent’s, the psychic power automatically fails. It can still cause Perils of the Warp as normal.
* If your model’s result is a failure, or a success but is lower than the opponent’s, the psychic power is used as normal.


Denying the Witch counts as a psychic power for the purpose of using multiple powers in one Turn, including suffering penalties if the model has already used powers this Turn, and is subject to Perils of the Warp. It is not otherwise considered a psychic power. A PSYKER can Deny the Witch only once during each Turn.
Perils of the Warp
Whenever a model uses a psychic power, if the result of at least one Success Roll made as part of that power is a 2 or a 12, then that model suffers Perils of the Warp, after any effects of the power, if any. When a model suffers Perils of the Warp, roll a D6 to determine what happens to it:
1. Dragged Into the Warp. The caster must make a Success Roll with -1 DICE for each psychic power it has used this Turn (including this one). On a failure, the caster is immediately taken Out of Action. On a success, the caster instead suffers D3 BLOOD MARKERS.
2. Mental Purge. The caster suffers 1 STUN MARKER and cannot use the psychic power that triggered the Perils of the Warp roll for the remainder of the battle.
3. Power Drain. The caster and each other PSYKER within 12” of it gain D3 STUN MARKERS each (roll once and use that result for all of them).
4. Psychic Backlash. The caster must roll on the Injury chart, with IGNORE ARMOUR.
5. Empyric Feedback. The caster gains 1 BLOOD MARKER.
6. Warp Surge. Until the end of the battle, the caster has +1 DICE to all PSYCHIC Success Rolls, but its psychic powers have PERILOUS ±2 and if it rolls this result again during this battle, it is treated as Dragged Into the Warp instead.


The PERILOUS ±X Keyword modifies the results that cause Perils of the Warp. For example, a power with PERILOUS ±2 causes Perils of the Warp on a roll of 2-4 and 10-12. PERILOUS always stacks with itself.
STUN MARKERS
STUN MARKERS are a new type of marker that function almost identically to BLOOD MARKERS, except you cannot spend them to add +DICE to Injury rolls or to cause a Blood Bath. You can spend them to apply -DICE to Success Rolls in the same manner as BLOOD or INFECTION MARKERS.


A model can have up to 6 STUN MARKERS in addition to any BLOOD or INFECTION MARKERS it may have.


Whenever an effect allows you to remove BLOOD MARKERS from one of your models, you can remove that many STUN MARKERS instead, or a mixture of the two.


Stunlock. In addition to the normal manner you can spend STUN MARKERS, when an enemy model activates, you can spend 6 of its STUN MARKERS to Stunlock that enemy, ending its Activation immediately. If the model is Down, you can spend 3 STUN MARKERS instead.
