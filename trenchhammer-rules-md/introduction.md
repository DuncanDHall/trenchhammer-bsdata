Introduction
What is this?
This is a hack of the Trench Crusade rules for the 40k universe. It uses the core rules from Trench Crusade (https://www.trenchcrusade.com/rules), including Actions, Blood Markers, Injury rolls, Keywords, campaign rules, etc., but has its own factions, battlekit, and mercenaries (and a few new keywords, one new movement type, and psychic powers).


There are currently 25 playable factions, or 100 if you include all variants. Some factions like Grey Knights or the god-specific Chaos Space Marines are technically variants instead of full factions, but they make heavy changes to their base factions.


Why are you doing this?
I had the idea and it would not leave my brain until I wrote it down. All of it.


Why not just play 40k?
I don’t personally like the 40k rules. Also I want a skirmish game. (If I want to play full army 40k, though, I can use Grimdark Future. Grimdark Future is great for big armies.)


How about Grimdark Future: Firefight?
Grimdark Future works very well, but Firefight is a little too simple and swingy of a skirmish game for me. Great as an intro game or something quick, but not what I really want long-term. A little more detail allows for that good good narrative to show through.


How about one of the many existing 40k one-off games?
I like Kill Team and I do play it sometimes, but it’s designed with competition in mind and not narrative weirdness, and I want more variety of units and customization.


Necromunda has a great setting with good narrative focus, but its rules are fundamentally 40k, and also janky, complicated, and labyrinthine, and it doesn’t include the normal 40k factions.


Kill Team 1st edition, Heralds of Ruin, and Shadow War Armageddon all bring in 40k factions, but still use 40k rules as a baseline. Which makes sense, as they are 40k skirmish games. What I want is perhaps unreasonable, but here we are. Come with me on this strange journey.


Or just play Trench Crusade?
Well, yeah. I do that too.


Does everything have to be 40k?
No, everything has to be Trench Crusade.
Who Am I?
I’m Chris “Goober” Ramsley (they/them). I make games. I currently work for Evil Genius Games creating the tabletop roleplaying game Everyday Heroes. Previously I’ve had some popular entries on the DM’s Guild for D&D, but I’ve been making stuff like this document forever. I’ve also been getting Trench Crusade going at my local store outside of Boston.


Fun fact: I have a degree in Interactive Media and Game Development.

Design Philosophy
Here are some ways in which I am designing this stuff.


Flyers. Most flying units in 40k also have Deep Strike, but Trench Crusade flyers typically don’t have any special setup. Some flying models get INFILTRATOR or DEEP STRIKE for other reasons.


Power Scaling Accuracy. When it comes to power level, I am leaning in the direction of 40k tabletop, as that allows things like Space Marines and Custodes to fight normal armies and have it be somewhat fair. But they should still feel more awesome than regular humans. Similarly, some of the light vehicles that are available have slightly reduced power to allow them to fit into a skirmish game better, and Necromunda gangs get to be a little more badass than usual.


Your Dudes. Customization is king. Lots of psychic power options add complexity, but more options is the goal here. Official 40k models should be mostly playable with their various weapon options available, plus lots more options.


Squad Leaders. Models like lieutenants, exarchs, or primes that are slightly cooler and normally lead full units don’t get their own special stat lines, but are instead intended to be regular models that have been promoted to Elite during a campaign.


Named Characters. Almost no named characters are included since Warbands are meant to be their own unique characters, but I try to include options to replicate the kinds of equipment and abilities they would have. That way you can include them if you like, use them as models for your own characters, or just use their traits as more options for customization.


Ongoing Effects. Trench Crusade mostly avoids having to remember any conditions or effects other than markers (blood, infection, blessing) and Down, but 40k has a lot of concepts that work best as temporary buffs, so I have included a number of these. You will likely want tokens or similar to track these conditions.
