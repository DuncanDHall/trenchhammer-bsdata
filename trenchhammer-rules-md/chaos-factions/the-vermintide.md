# The Vermintide

Vermintide Special Rules
Warp Tunnels. Your SKAVEN models have the BURROW Keyword.


Conniving Power Struggle. During a campaign, keep track of the Conniving Points of each of your Elite models, beginning at 10 for your Warband leader and 0 for each other Elite, including when a new Elite is recruited or a model is promoted to Elite.


Your Elite models gain Conniving Points under the following circumstances:
               * Crush-Win. Your Warband leader gains D3 Conniving Points whenever you win a battle, or 1 if you tie.
               * Think-Plan. Each model besides your Warband leader automatically gains D3 Conniving Points at the end of each battle, or 3 if you lost the battle.
               * Look-Look. An Elite model gains 1 Conniving Point each time the model performs a Glorious Deed.
               * Kill-Kill Them. An Elite model gains 1 Conniving Point each time the model takes an enemy Elite model Out of Action.
               * Not Me. Whenever one of your Elite models is taken Out of Action, each of your other Elite models within 12” of it gains 1 Conniving Point.


Masterstroke
At the end of each battle, following the exploration step, if your Warband leader has 20 or more Conniving Points and none of your other Elites have more Conniving Points than it, its plans to suppress its allies come to fruition in a masterstroke. You earn 2 Glory and your Warband leader earns 2 additional XP. Then reset your Warband leader to Conniving Points equal to 10 minus 2 for every time it has achieved a masterstroke since it last became your Warband leader, and the rest of your Elites’ Conniving Points to 0.


Power Upset
At the end of each battle, following the exploration step, if any of your Elites besides your warband leader has more Conniving Points than your Warband Leader, that model attempts to take greater control of your Warband in an upset. If two or more of your Elites meet this requirement, only the one with the highest Conniving Points does this. Choose randomly in case of a tie. When this happens, roll a D6 to determine what happens:
               * 1: Banishment. The upsetting Elite model is removed from your Warband.
               * 2: Beaten Down. The upsetting Elite model must roll on the Elite Trauma table.
               * 3-4: Grudging Respect. You earn 1 Glory and the upsetting Elite model earns 1 additional XP.
               * 5-6: Ascension. The upsetting Elite model becomes your new Warband leader. Your previous leader loses the LEADER Keyword and the upsetting Elite model gains it. You earn 2 Glory and the chosen Elite model earns 2 additional XP.


Regardless of the result, reset your Warband leader to 10 Conniving Points, and the rest of your Elites to 0.
Vermintide Patrons
Your patron must be The Great Horned Rat.
Patron: The Great Horned Rat
               * Choking Fumes. Enemies within 1” of this model that do not have NEGATE GAS have -1 DICE to all Success Rolls.
               * Mindless And Rabid. This model gains FEAR if it does not already have it.
               * Obscenely Good Fortune. This model begins each battle with D3 BLESSING MARKERS.
               * Scurrying Menace. This model gains the SKIRMISHER Keyword if it does not already have it, and it can move an additional 2” when it uses SKIRMISHER.
               * Truly Ravenous. Once during each of its Activations, when this model inflicts 1 or more BLOOD MARKERS on an enemy with a melee attack, remove 1 BLOOD MARKER from this model.
               * Vermindoom Vanguard. This model has +1 INJURY DICE with its melee attacks.

Warband Variant: Plague Vermin
               * Rats of Nurgle. All of your non-mercenary models gain the NURGLE Keyword. Your Patron must be the Nurgle Shared Patron.

               * Plague Vermin Battlekit. You cannot take any Flamers, Hand Flamers, or Heavy Flamers, but add the following battlekit to your Armoury:
               * Hand Plague Spewer (10 credits, LIMIT: 1, Elite Only). 6”, FLAMETHROWER, IGNORE ARMOUR, -1 INJURY DICE, GAS
