# Heretic Astartes

  Heretic Astartes Special Rules
Dark Pacts. As an Action with a Success Roll, any of your HERETIC ASTARTES models can attempt to make a Dark Pact. On a success, that model gains your choice of +1 DICE to Hit or +1 INJURY DICE with all weapons until the end of its Activation. Whether or not the roll succeeds, the model gains a BLOOD MARKER at the end of its Activation.


Dread Reputation. During a campaign, keep track of your Personal Reputation, Dark Gods Reputation, and Warfleet Reputation, each starting at 4. They cannot be reduced below 1 or increased above 8. They are modified in the following circumstances:
               * At the end of each battle, reduce each Reputation by 1.
               * Add 1 to any one Reputation for every Glorious Deed you perform during a battle.
               * Add D3, distributed as you like between each Reputation, when you win a battle.
               * Add 1 to any one Reputation if you tie in a battle.


While a Reputation is at 7 or 8, you are Favored in that Reputation. While it is at 1 or 2, you are Forsaken in that reputation. You gain benefits and penalties as follows:
               * Favored Personal Reputation. At the end of each battle, if your Warband leader took at least two enemy models Out of Action, it earns an additional 1 XP.
               * Favored Dark Gods Reputation. At the end of each battle, you can purchase one Mark of Chaos for one of your models for free, following normal limitations. If you do, reduce your Dark Gods Reputation by 2.
               * Favored Warfleet Reputation. You have the Extra Dice and Reroll Exploration Skills, stacking with any other instances of those skills.
               * Forsaken Personal Reputation. Any time you lose a battle, after casualties and Trauma rolls, one of your champions challenges for leadership. Choose one of your Elite models that is not your Warband leader and roll a D6. On a 3+, the chosen model must roll on the Elite Trauma chart. On a 1-2, remove your Warband leader from your Warband, and the chosen model becomes your new Warband leader and gains the LEADER and TOUGH Keywords. You can recruit a new model of the type of your previous leader, but that model loses LEADER and TOUGH.
               * Forsaken Dark Gods Reputation. At the end of each battle, choose one of your Elite models and roll a D6. On a 5+, nothing happens. On a 1-4, that model must roll on the Elite Trauma chart.
               * Forsaken Warfleet Reputation. You cannot spend any Glory on battlekit or Mercenaries.

On a success, place the summoned model at the chosen point, and it counts as one of your models until the end of the battle.

Each PSYKER with this power can have only one summoned model on the battlefield at any given time, regardless of who controls it. They can use this power again if their current summoned model is under your control, removing the existing model before placing the new one, but not if it is under your opponent’s control.

An Elite model gains Claimed Skulls whenever it takes an enemy model Out of Action in melee: 4 for the enemy leader, 3 for any other ELITE model, 2 for any other TOUGH model, and 1 for any other model. When a non-Elite model takes an enemy Out of Action in melee, the nearest of your Elite models to it gains the Claimed Skulls.


At any time during the quartermaster step between battles, one or more of your models can offer their collected skulls to Khorne. When they do, roll a number of D6 depending on how much XP it has, and reduce its total Claimed Skulls by that amount (minimum 0).
               * 0-3 XP: 1D6
               * 4-9 XP: 2D6
               * 10+ XP: 3D6

After this roll, if the model has 0 Claimed Skulls, its offering is deemed unworthy and there is no benefit. If it still has Claimed Skulls, it gains a benefit depending on how many, and then its Claimed Skulls are reset to 0.
               * 1-10 Claimed Skulls: +1 XP
               * 11-20 Claimed Skulls: +2 XP and you gain 1 Glory
               * 21+ Claimed Skulls: +3 XP and you gain 2 Glory
               * Butcher’s Nails. Your Chaos Lord, Chaos Cultist (Jakhal), Chaos Space Marines, and Chaos Terminator models gain the Blood Surge ability, but cannot be equipped with any ranged weapons besides Pistols, Grenades, and Blood Harpoons.
               * Blood Surge. When this model Charges, roll 2D6 instead of 1D6 and then add the highest of the two dice to their charge move.

               * Jakhals. Your Chaos Cultists are known as Jakhals. They have +1” movement speed and cost +5 credits. Up to half of them, rounded up, can be upgraded to Goremongers for an additional +5 credits, granting them the INFILTRATOR Keyword.
