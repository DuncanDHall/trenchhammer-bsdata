# Chaos Daemons

Chaos Daemons Special Rules
Daemon Legions. You can recruit models from any of the four Legions listed below. You must include exactly one model with the LEADER Keyword as your Warband’s leader and cannot include any other models with the LEADER Keyword, except via the Daemon Prince’s Overlord ability.


Depending on your leader’s other Keywords, the following additional restrictions apply:
               * KHORNE: You cannot recruit any models from the Legion of Excess.
               * NURGLE: You cannot recruit any models from the Scintillating Legion.
               * SLAANESH: You cannot recruit any models from the Blood Legion.
               * TZEENTCH: You cannot recruit any models from the Plague Legion.
               * UNDIVIDED: No other restrictions.


Warp Entities. At the start of each battle, you can select up to half of your DAEMON models, rounded up. Those models gain the DEEP STRIKE Keyword during this battle.


The Great Game. During a campaign, keep track of the influence of each god on your Warband, called Ascendency. When you first create your Warband, the gods have the following  Ascendency:
               * Khorne: 4 Ascendency
               * Tzeentch: 3 Ascendency
               * Nurgle: 2 Ascendency
               * Slaanesh: 1 Ascendency


At the end of each battle, each god gains D3 Ascendency in the following order: Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, Slaanesh. Then the god corresponding to the Keyword of your Warband leader gains 1 Ascendency, or D3 Ascendency if you won the battle. If your Warband leader has the UNDIVIDED Keyword, each of the gods gains 1 Ascendency, or D3 if you won, in the order above.


The gods can never have the same Ascendency. After gaining any Ascendency, if a god has the same Ascendency as another, the god that just gained Ascendency gains 1 more.


Benefits and Penalties
During each battle, your models with a god’s Keyword have the following benefits or penalties, depending on its Ascendency:
               * Highest Ascendency: Once per battle, you can reroll one Success Roll made by, or Injury roll made against, one of these models. If your Warband leader has this god’s Keyword, its LEADER Keyword adds an additional +1 DICE to Morale tests.
               * Second Highest Ascendency: Once per battle, you can grant one Success Roll made by one of these models +1 DICE, or give one Injury roll made against one of them -1 DICE.
               * Third Highest Ascendency: No effect.
               * Lowest Ascendency: -1 DICE to Hit any model with another god’s Keyword. If your Warband leader has this Keyword, its LEADER Keyword does not add any bonus to Morale tests.


Rewards
At the end of every 4th battle, you can assign the following rewards to your Elite models, with a maximum of 1 reward per model:
               * Highest Ascendency: One Elite model with the Keyword of the god with the highest Ascendency, or with the UNDIVIDED Keyword, earns an additional 2 XP, and you can remove 1 Battle Scar and its corresponding Trauma from that model.
               * Second Highest Ascendency: One Elite model with the Keyword of the god with the second highest Ascendency, or with the UNDIVIDED Keyword, earns an additional 2 XP.
               * Third Highest Ascendency: One Elite model with the Keyword of the god with the third highest Ascendency, or with the UNDIVIDED Keyword, earns an additional 1 XP.


Then reset each god’s Ascendency to a value based on its current position:
               * Highest Ascendency: 4
               * Second Highest Ascendency: 3
               * Third Highest Ascendency: 2
               * Lowest Ascendency: 1


Optional: Combining the Great Game
If multiple Chaos Daemons Warbands are participating in the same campaign, you can optionally track the Ascendency of the gods together. In this case, Ascendency values are shared between those players, and the gods only gain the base D3 Ascendency after each battle once after each Chaos Daemons Warband has completed that battle. All other increases are applied from each player in a random order. Rewards are applied only after each player has finished their battle and applied their Ascendency increases.
	Chaos Cult Patrons
Your patron must be one of the following Shared Patrons, depending on your Warband leader’s Keywords:
               * KHORNE: Khorne.
               * NURGLE: Nurgle.
               * SLAANESH: Slaanesh.
               * TZEENTCH: Tzeentch.
               * UNDIVIDED: Chaos Undivided
