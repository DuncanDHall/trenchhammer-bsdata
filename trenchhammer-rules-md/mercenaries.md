# Mercenaries

Mercenaries are separated into four main categories: Imperial, Chaos, Xenos, and Outlaw. By default, a Warband of the corresponding type can take any Mercenaries from the appropriate category, except for Xenos who can only take Mercenaries that match their exact Faction.


Mercenaries are further categorized into sub-categories, but besides Xenos, this is for organizational purposes only.


Many Mercenaries have more specific limits or requirements, and some Mercenaries can be taken by Warbands of other categories.
