# The Inferno

                     * Forces
No special restrictions apply to the models the players can include in their Forces in this scenario.
                     * The Battlefield
The battlefield is 48”x48”. The players roll-off and the winner sets up the terrain for the game, with the following additional rules.
Ore
Place Ore as shown. Each Ore is an objective with a 25mm base.
Safe Buildings
Buildings, large enough to enter and be occupied by a number of models of all sizes, should be placed as shown.
                     * Deployment
The player that did not set up the terrain chooses which Deployment Zone will be theirs. The other Deployment Zone is their opponent’s. The players then alternate deploying their models one at a time, starting with the player who has more models in their Warband (roll-off if both players have the same number of models). Models must be set up wholly within their own Deployment Zone. If a player runs out of models to set up, the other player sets up all their remaining models, one after another until they have none left. Once the players have set up their models, deployment ends and the game begins.
Infiltrators
Infiltrators must be placed at least 4" away from any Ore.
                     * Ore
                     * During the game, any model that ends its move in contact with a piece of Ore picks can pick it up as an Action with no roll required. A model can carry only one Ore at a time. That model is now carrying the object and will carry it until it drops it or is destroyed. At the end of its activation, the model chooses to either keep the object, drop it, or pass it to any friendly model within 1” range as long as neither model is in melee combat with an enemy.
                     * If they pass it, the model receiving the object is considered to have ended their Activation this turn, if it has not have done so yet. If a model carrying an object is taken Out of Action the object is immediately thrown D6” in a direction chosen by the opposing player, though never out of the battlefield. Stop if the object moves into contact with a barrier, just outside it. If it lands on top of a model, the model can immediately pick it up, except if there is also an enemy model in melee combat with it. If the model does not pick it up, it is thrown again.
If a model enters close combat with an enemy, it must place any Ore it is holding on the ground within 1” of it.
The Wall of Fire
________________
Beginning 5" from each of the shown corners, place lines representing Walls of Fire at a 45 degree angle.
At the end of each turn besides the last, move each line representing a Wall of Fire 5" away from its starting corner, directly towards the opposite corner, as shown. At the end of the final turn, the lines each move all the way to the center, putting everything on the battlefield behind them.
Any model that moves into the area behind a Wall of Fire line, or that a Wall of Fire line moves past, even partially, is automatically taken Out of Action. Any Ore it was carrying is lost. Additionally, remove any un-carried Ore a Wall of Fire line moves past, even partially.
Any model or Ore that is entirely inside one of the indicated Safe Buildings ignores the effects of the Walls of Fire, but the Walls block line of sight.
A model that is Downed within 1” of a Wall of Fire, including an entrance/exit to a Safe Building once it is overtaken, must take an Action to avoid falling into it, as with falling off of the edge of raised terrain.
Game Length
The battle lasts for five turns, no matter what.
A failed Morale roll can never cause a warband to retreat during this mission, and always results in becoming Shaken during the next round.
If a player’s entire force is removed, their opponent continues to the end of the game, gathering whatever Ore they can and attempting to get their models inside Safe Buildings before the Walls of Fire incinerate them.
                     * Victory Conditions
A player wins this scenario immediately if there are no enemy models on the battlefield or if the opposing Warband flees (typically due to failing a Morale Check). Otherwise, the player with more Victory Points at the end of the game is the winner.
Victory Points
Ore. At the end of the game, each player earns 10 VP for each Ore any of their models on the battlefield is carrying, or that are inside of a Safe Building they control. A player controls a Safe Building if they have at least one model inside of it, and their enemy has none.
Enemies Killed. Each player earns additional VP equal to the total credit values (including battlekit) of enemy models they took Out of Action during the mission divided by 50, plus the Glory cost of those models divided by 10, rounding down after adding them together.
Note that a model taken Out of Action by a Wall of Fire does not count towards VP unless their opponent forced the model into that Wall by one of their own model's actions. It may well be more honorable to dive into the fire than be killed by the enemy!
Survivors. Each player also earns additional VP equal to the credit values (including battlekit) of their own models that are on the battlefield at the end of the game divided by 100, plus the Glory cost of those models divided by 30, rounding down after adding them together. (These will have to be inside of Safe Buildings, as the Walls of Fire overtake the whole battlefield at the end of the final round).
                     * Glorious Deeds
There are no Glorious Deeds in this scenario, only what remains when the fire dies out.
