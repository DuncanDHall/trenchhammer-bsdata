# Industrial Zone

                     * Forces
No special restrictions apply to the models the players can include in their Forces in this scenario.
                     * The Battlefield
The players roll-off and the winner sets up the terrain for the game, with the following additional rules.
Machinery
Place four pieces of terrain that can be entered and/or stood on as shown. These terrain pieces are Machines. Place a Power Supply marker in the center of each.
A player controls a Machine terrain piece if there are more friendly models on, in, or within 1" of the terrain piece than there are enemy models. If one player has any models on the terrain piece and their opponent does not, then the player with models on the terrain piece controls it even if their opponent has more models within 1" of the Objective.
Powered Junk
Place three 1” Powered Junk Markers as shown. A model within 1” of a Powered Junk Marker can attempt to harvest it with the Harvest Action:
                     * Harvest. The model makes a Risky Success Roll. On a success, it picks up a Power Cell Marker from that Powered Junk, as described below. On a failure, the model gains a STUN MARKER and place a Power Cell Marker within 1” of it. Regardless of the outcome, the Powered Junk Marker is removed.


Power Cells
As an Action with no Success Roll, a model within 1” of a Power Cell Marker can pick up that marker. Put the Power Cell Marker in contact with the model’s base to show it is carrying it. The only thing a model carrying a cell can do is take Move, Retreat, or Power On Actions – it cannot do anything else while it has the power cell.
                     * At the end of its Activation, you can say that a model that is carrying a power cell will either drop it or hand it to a friendly model that is within 1". When a model drops the power cell, place it within 1" of the model and not in contact with any other models. When a model hands the power cell on, place the Power Cell Marker in contact with the other model’s base.
                     * If a model carrying a cell is taken Down or Out of Action, or is chosen as the target of a Melee Attack, it immediately drops the power cell as described above.


Powering Machines
A model that is within a Machine can take the Power On or Power Off Actions.
                     * Power On. A model carrying a Power Cell Marker can take this action, which requires no Success Roll. Place its Power Cell Marker on top of that terrain piece’s Power Source, and that marker cannot be picked up again without a Power Off Action. While the Machine has this marker on it, it is Powered.
                     * Power Off. A model within 1” of a Power Source that has a Power Cell Marker on it can take the Power Off Action. The Machine ceases to be Powered, and the model must make a Risky Success Roll. On a success, it picks up the Power Cell Marker. On a failure, it suffers a STUN MARKER and place the Power Cell Marker within 1” of it. A model cannot take this Action if it is within 1” of any enemies or if there is an enemy within 1” of the Power Source.
                     * Deployment
The player that did not set up the terrain chooses which Deployment Zone will be theirs. The other Deployment Zone is their opponent’s. The players then alternate deploying their models one at a time, starting with the player who has more models in their Warband (roll-off if both players have the same number of models). Models must be set up wholly within their own Deployment Zone. If a player runs out of models to set up, the other player sets up all their remaining models, one after another until they have none left. Once the players have set up their models, deployment ends and the game begins.
Infiltrators
Infiltrators can deploy normally or by using their special deployment rules, but must be placed at least 8” away from any Powered Junk Markers.
                     * Industrial Accidents
The machinery here is dangerous and constantly malfunctioning. Injury rolls made as a result of a Fall or due to Dangerous Terrain have +1 INJURY DICE.


At the start of each Turn after the first, one of the players must roll a D6. On a roll of 1-3 nothing happens, but on a 4-6, an Industrial Accident takes place. Roll a D3 and look up the roll on the table below to see what happens.
                     1. Power Surge. Each model on or within a Powered Machine terrain piece or within 3” of a Powered Junk Marker must roll on the Injury chart. This injury has the STUN MARKERS and STUN Keywords.
                     2. Pouring Smoke. During this Turn and the next, Ranged Attacks made by or against models within any Powered Machine terrain piece or within 3” of a Powered Junk Marker have their range halved.
                     3. Steam Vent. During this Turn, the area within 3” of a Powered Machine’s Power Source or a Powered Junk Marker is considered Dangerous Terrain. Injuries from this terrain have the FIRE Keyword.
Game Length
This scenario lasts four Turns.
                     * Victory Conditions
A player wins this scenario immediately if there are no enemy models on the battlefield or if the opposing Warband flees (typically due to failing a Morale Check). Otherwise, the player with more Victory Points at the end of the game is the winner.
Victory Points
At the end of each round after the first, each player earns 1 VP for each Machine they control, or 2 VP if it is Powered.
Players earn 1 VP for each scored Glorious Deed, as normal.
                     * Glorious Deeds
Accident Master. Satisfy one of the following (this deed can still be scored only once):
                     * Spend at least 2 STUN Markers on an enemy Success Roll during a Turn in which it was subjected to Power Surge.
                     * A friendly model takes an enemy Out of Action while suffering penalties for Long Range and while one or both models are within Pouring Smoke.
                     * A friendly model moves into Dangerous Terrain caused by Steam Vent from outside and takes an enemy model Out of Action while within that terrain in the same activation.
Bloodletting. An attack made by a friendly model results in the sixth BLOOD MARKER being placed beside an enemy model.
Hold Your Ground. A Warband is the first to pass a Morale Check in this game. In a campaign game you can award 1 Experience Point to 1 ELITE model from the Warband that has the LEADER Keyword if you have one available.
Into the Gears. A friendly model causes an enemy model that is on a Machine to Fall and the Fall results in it being taken Out of Action.
Stolen Power. A friendly model successfully uses the Power Off Action and ends that activation outside of the Machine it used the action in.
Suicidal Bravery. A friendly model successfully charges two models with the same charge move.
