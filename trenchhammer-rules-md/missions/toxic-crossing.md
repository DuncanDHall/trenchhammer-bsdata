# Toxic Crossing

                     * Forces
No special restrictions apply to the models the players can include in their Forces in this scenario.
                     * The Battlefield
The battlefield is 36”x36”. The players roll-off and the winner sets up the terrain for the game, with the following additional rules.
River
Include a 3-4"-wide toxic river through the center of the map with 2D3 crossings. At least one crossing should be between platforms that are 3" tall or higher. The river should be symmetrical, with ends that are somewhat off-center. It can be curved or straight.
The river counts as both Difficult and Dangerous Terrain, and injury rolls caused by it have the GAS Keyword. BUROWING movement cannot ignore the river.
Models that are Downed within 1” of the river must roll to avoid falling into it as if they were at the edge of a cliff.
                     * Deployment
The player that did not set up the terrain chooses which Deployment Zone will be theirs. The other Deployment Zone is their opponent’s. The players then alternate deploying their models one at a time, starting with the player who has more models in their Warband (roll-off if both players have the same number of models). Models must be set up wholly within their own Deployment Zone. If a player runs out of models to set up, the other player sets up all their remaining models, one after another until they have none left. Once the players have set up their models, deployment ends and the game begins.
Infiltrators
Infiltrators must be placed on their owner’s side of the river.
                     * Escaping
The center of the edge of the battlefield opposite a player’s deployment zone is that player’s Escape Points. A model that comes into contact with its owner’s Escape Point escapes the battlefield. Remove it from the battlefield, but it still counts as on the battlefield, and not Down or Out of Action, for the purposes of morale.
A model with DEEP STRIKE cannot be deployed using that Keyword anywhere within 12” of its owner’s Escape Point.
Game Length
The battle lasts for five turns.
                     * Victory Conditions
A player wins this scenario immediately if there are no enemy models on the battlefield or if the opposing Warband flees (typically due to failing a Morale Check). Otherwise, the player with more Victory Points at the end of the game is the winner.
Victory Points
At the end of the game, each player earns VP equal to the credit values (including battlekit) of their models that escaped the battlefield, divided by 100, plus the Glory cost of those models divided by 30, rounding down after adding them together.
                     * Players earn 1 VP for each scored Glorious Deed, as normal.
                     * Glorious Deeds
Cast them Down. A friendly model causes an enemy model to Fall from a height of at least 3" (e.g. by taking it Down near a ledge or by forcing it off a ledge in some way).
Into the River. A friendly model takes an enemy that is wholly within the river Out of Action, that was not wholly within the river at the start of your model's activation.
Parkour. A friendly model succeeds on two Jump and/or Climb Success Rolls during a single Activation.
Speedrun. A friendly model escapes the battlefield before the end of the third Turn.
Toxic Fording. A friendly model crosses the entire river, beginning entirely on one side and ending entirely on the other, in one activation with a model that does not have FLYING.
Whirlwind. A friendly model takes two enemies Out of Action with melee attacks in a single Turn.
