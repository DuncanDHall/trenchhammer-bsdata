# Fragile Bounty

                     * Forces
No special restrictions apply to the models the players can include in their Forces in this scenario.
                     * The Battlefield
The players roll-off and the winner sets up the terrain for the game, with the following additional rules.
Objectives
Place five 1” objective markers, one in the center of the battlefield, and the other four symmetrically (mirrored between table halves, opposite quarters, or both), each at least 10” away from other objectives.
Controlling Objectives
A player controls an objective if they have more models within 3” of that objective that are not Down than their opponent.
                     * Deployment
The player that did not set up the terrain chooses which Deployment Zone will be theirs. The other Deployment Zone is their opponent’s. The players then alternate deploying their models one at a time, starting with the player who has more models in their Warband (roll-off if both players have the same number of models). Models must be set up wholly within their own Deployment Zone. If a player runs out of models to set up, the other player sets up all their remaining models, one after another until they have none left. Once the players have set up their models, deployment ends and the game begins.
Infiltrators
Infiltrators can deploy normally or by using their special deployment rules. They cannot be deployed within 6” of an objective.
                     * Fragile Spoils
Keep track of the Durability of each Objective, beginning at 6 Durability for each Objective besides the center objective, and 10 Durability for the center objective.
Whenever one of the following occurs, remove 1 Durability from an Objective. Once an Objective reaches 0 Durability, remove it from the battlefield.
                     * A model passes within 3” of the Objective while Charging.
                     * A model passes within 3” of the Objective while Dashing.
                     * A model is Downed or taken Out of Action while within 3” of the Objective.
                     * Consume Bounty
A model within 1” of an Objective whose owner controls that Objective can take the Consume Action.
                     * Consume. Reduce the Durability of the Objective by 1. This model gains a Blessing Marker.
Game Length
At the end of the fourth Turn, one player rolls a D6. On a 1 or 2, the game ends immediately. On a 3 or more, the game will end at the end of the fifth Turn.
                     * Victory Conditions
A player wins this scenario immediately if there are no enemy models on the battlefield or if the opposing Warband flees (typically due to failing a Morale Check). Otherwise, the player with more Victory Points at the end of the game is the winner.
Victory Points
At the end of each round, each player earns VP equal to the current Durability of each objective they control, except for the center objective during the first Turn.
Players earn 3 VP for each scored Glorious Deed, instead of the normal 1.
                     * Glorious Deeds
Bloody Spoils. A friendly model takes a Down enemy Out of Action with a Bloodbath while that enemy is within 3” of an Objective.
Cast Them Down. A friendly model causes an enemy model to Fall from a height of at least 3" (e.g. by taking the enemy model Down near a ledge, or by forcing it off a ledge in some way).
Elite Hunter. A friendly model takes two enemy models with the ELITE Keyword Out of Action.
Preservation. Control an objective that has not lost any Durability at the end of the fourth or fifth turn, while all other Objectives have lost at least 1 Durability.
Ruin. A friendly model causes 3 or more Durability to be lost from a single Objective during a single Activation.
Show of Mercy. A friendly model Retreats from Melee Combat with an enemy that is Down.
