# High Speed

                     * Forces
No special restrictions apply to the models the players can include in their Forces in this scenario.
                     * The Battlefield
The players roll-off and the winner sets up the terrain for the game, with the following additional rules.
Traffic
All terrain is considered to be moving platforms: vehicles, icebergs, stampeding beasts, etc. Terrain should be thick, but be mostly made up of many smaller pieces, the majority of which should allow models to stand on them. Cover, raised areas, and even full buildings are also appropriate, either on top of other raised terrain, or assumed to be somehow moving as well.
At least one piece of terrain must be equidistant between deployment zones, and at least four other terrain pieces are within 6” of the center line of the battlefield.
Choose a direction traffic is moving.
Objective
Place five 1” objective markers, one on a piece of terrain that is equidistant between deployment zones, one on each of the two terrain pieces wholly within 6” of the center line of the battlefield that are closest to one player's deployment zone, and one on each of the two terrain pieces wholly within 6” of the center line of the battlefield that are closest to the other player's deployment zone.
A terrain piece with one of these markers is considered an Objective terrain piece. The exact location of the marker on that terrain piece is unimportant.
Controlling Objectives
A player controls an Objective terrain piece if there are more friendly models on the terrain piece than there are enemy models.
                     * Deployment
The player that did not set up the terrain chooses which Deployment Zone will be theirs. The other Deployment Zone is their opponent’s. The players then alternate deploying their models one at a time, starting with the player who has more models in their Warband (roll-off if both players have the same number of models). Models must be set up wholly within their own Deployment Zone. If a player runs out of models to set up, the other player sets up all their remaining models, one after another until they have none left. Once the players have set up their models, deployment ends and the game begins.
Infiltrators
Infiltrators can deploy normally or by using their special deployment rules.
                     * Traffic
Terrain pieces are always moving, but the battlefield follows them. The ground below is therefore Dangerous Terrain, but the Success Roll to avoid injury is made at -2 DICE. Whenever a model is subject to this Dangerous Terrain, whether or not the Success Roll is successful, it is moved 9” directly opposite the direction traffic is moving. It stops if it collides with any terrain or the battlefield edge, and if it does, it immediately suffers an Injury with +1 Injury Dice.


The ground is also considered Difficult Terrain unless a model is moving opposite in the direction traffic is moving, at up to a 45 degree angle.


Jumping
During this mission, any model can jump between terrain pieces that are up to 1” away without requiring a Jump Success Roll.


Commendeering
A model that is on a piece of terrain that no enemy is also on can attempt to move that terrain as an Action. To do so, it makes a Risky Success Roll, and on a success, the owner of that model can move the terrain piece — counting an entire assembly of a platform and anything on top of it as one piece — up to 6”. This movement is subject to the same Difficult Terrain as models on the ground, and it cannot move through other terrain pieces.
Game Length
This scenario lasts four Turns.
                     * Victory Conditions
A player wins this scenario immediately if there are no enemy models on the battlefield or if the opposing Warband flees (typically due to failing a Morale Check). Otherwise, the player with more Victory Points at the end of the game is the winner.
Victory Points
At the end of each Turn, each player scores 2 VPs for each Objective terrain piece they control.
Players earn 1 VP for each scored Glorious Deed, as normal.
                     * Glorious Deeds
Feigned Retreat. A friendly model Retreats from Melee Combat and then hits the enemy it escaped from with a ranged attack during the same Activation.
Getaway. A friendly model Commondeers an Objective terrain piece and moves it into its owner’s Deployment Zone.
Parkour. A friendly model succeeds on two Jump and/or Climb Success Rolls during a single Activation.
The Real Killer. A friendly model takes an enemy model that is on Dangerous or Difficult terrain Out of Action.
Ramming Speed. A friendly model Commondeers a terrain piece and moves it into contact with another terrain piece, then takes an enemy on that second terrain piece Out of Action with a melee attack in the same Activation.
Roadrash. A friendly model causes an enemy model to Fall onto the battlefield ground, off of any terrain (e.g. by taking the enemy model Down near a ledge, or by forcing it off a ledge in some way).
