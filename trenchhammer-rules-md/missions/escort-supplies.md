# Escort Supplies

                     * Forces
Before picking their Forces, the players must decide who is the attacker and who is the defender in this scenario. In a campaign, the player with the most models in their Warband (ignoring their Threshold Values or Field Strength) is the attacker, and their opponent is the defender. If both players have the same number of models, and in one-off games, the players roll-off and the winner must decide who will be the attacker and who will be the defender.
The defender must halve the number of credits they can spend on their Warband in this scenario.
The defender will additionally need three transports: light vehicle models such as trucks or APCs, and the players will need a handful (a maximum of 5) of Raider models: ramshackle neutral warriors.
                     * The Battlefield
The battlefield is 48”x48”. The players roll-off and the winner sets up the terrain for the game, with the following additional rules.
Roads
Make sure there are three open roads from one side of the battlefield to the other, at least as wide as the transports.
                     * Deployment
The attacker’s deployment zone is the green zone at the bottom of the shown map, while the attacker’s are the two red areas in the upper corners. The players then alternate deploying their models one at a time, starting with the player who has more models in their Warband (roll-off if both players have the same number of models). Models must be set up wholly within their own Deployment Zone. If a player runs out of models to set up, the other player sets up all their remaining models, one after another until they have none left. Once the players have set up their models, deployment ends and the game begins.
Infiltrators
Infiltrators can deploy normally or by using their special deployment rules. The attacker’s Infiltrators cannot be deployed within 12” of any transport.
                     * The Transport
At the start of the game, before deployment, the defender places a transport in the center of each of the three roads, touching the table edge. Keep track of the Supply inside each transport, beginning at 3.
Transports count as models that belong to the defender, as well as Impassable Terrain that provides cover as normal. They cannot be forced to move in any way, and they have -3 Armour. They have the ARTIFICIAL and VEHICLE Keywords unless the defender is Tyranids. They treat all Out of Action results as Down results. When activated, the only Action a transport can take is Ranged Attack. They have +1 Ranged Skill and the following weapon:
                     * Transport Defense Cannon. 12”, +1 INJURY DICE, PISTOL
Whenever a transport would be Downed, instead one Supply is removed from it (it suffers other effects such as BLOOD MARKERS normally), and the attacker places a Crate Marker anywhere within 3” of that transport. The crate can be placed on one of the attacker’s models, in which case that model is carrying the crate (see below). If the transport has 0 Supply, instead nothing happens.
At the end of each Turn, move each transport 10” along the road, towards the opposite edge of the table from the one it began at. Transports can move through any model. When a transport moves onto or through a model, that model must roll on the Injury chart, treating any Minor Hit result as Down instead. If a transport would end its movement overlapping any other model, move that model to the nearest open space after it rolls on the Injury Chart.
At the end of the fifth Turn, the transports move off the battlefield and the game ends (after they run over any models in the way).
                     * Supplies
As an Action with no Success Roll, a model within 1” of a Supply Crate Marker can pick up that marker. Put the Supply Crate Marker in contact with the model’s base to show it is carrying it. The only thing a model carrying a crate can do is take Move or Retreat Actions - it cannot do anything else while it has the crate.
                     * At the end of its Activation, you can say that a model that is carrying a crate will either drop it or hand it to a friendly model that is within 1". When a model drops the crate, place it within 1" of the model and not in contact with any other models. When a model hands the crate on, place the Supply Crate Marker in contact with the other model’s base.
                     * The model can destroy the crate as an Action that requires no Success Roll. If it does, remove the Supply Crate Marker from the game.
                     * If a model carrying a crate is taken Down or Out of Action, or is chosen as the target of a Melee Attack, it immediately drops the crate as described above.
                     * If a model belonging to the attacker that is carrying a crate finishes its Activation in contact with any edge of the battlefield, it can escape with the crate; remove the model and the Supply Crate Marker from the battlefield. The model is still considered part of the Warband for the purposes of Morale Checks.
                     * If a model belonging to the defender that is carrying a crate finishes its Activation in contact with a transport that has less than 3 Supply, it can return the crate to that transport. Remove the Supply Crate Marker from the battlefield and increase the Supply of that transport by 1.
                     * Raiders
At the start of each Turn after the second, the defender rolls D3 and places that many Raiders on the battlefield. Raiders are neutral models (see below). They can be represented by any simple warrior or soldier models, preferably those that look ragged. For each Raider, the defender places that model on the battlefield edge furthest from their Deployment Zone, as close as possible to D6” away from the center point in a random direction (with a D6: 1-3 left, 4-6 right).


There can be a maximum of 5 Raiders on the battlefield at any given time. If more would be placed, skip them.


Neutral Model Activation Rolls
Raiders are neutral models. Neutral models are treated as enemy models by both sides. In addition, when a player finishes an Activation with one of their models, they must take a Neutral Model Activation Roll by rolling a D6. If they roll a 1-4, they can Activate a neutral model of their choice. They cannot Activate a neutral model that has already been Activated (by either player). Once all of the neutral models have been Activated during a Turn, stop making Neutral Model Activation Rolls until the following Turn.


When a player Activates a Raider, they must carry out an Activation with it using the rules below. If a player runs out of models from their own Warband to Activate and there are still Raiders remaining to Activate, they must still make Neutral Model Activation Rolls. In the event that any Raiders remain to be Activated after both players have finished Activating models from their Warband, just roll-off for each one, the winner must Activate the model.


Raider Actions
When a player Activates a Raider, they must first choose its target (see below). They must then take 1 Move ACTION and 1 Dash ACTION or 1 Fight ACTION with the Raider. If the Raider is not within 1" of its target, it will move as described below and then Fight (or pick up) if it is within 1" of its target or Dash if it is not. If the Raider starts within 1" of its target, it will attack before it moves. If the attack takes the target Out of Action, choose a new target and then move the Raider as described below.


The Raider’s chosen target is determined by using the following list of priorities:
                     * If the Raider is carrying a Supply Crate Marker, its target is the nearest point on the battlefield edge. If it reaches the battlefield edge, remove it and the crate from the battlefield.
                     * Otherwise, if there is a Supply Crate Marker that is not being held within 20” of the Raider, that marker is its target, and if it moves into contact with it, picks it up.
                     * Otherwise, if there are any models within 20" of the Raider that are carrying a Supply Crate Marker, then it will choose a model with a crate as its target. If two or more models are carrying crates, it will choose the closest as its target. If two or more models are equally close, the player can choose which model is its target. The transport counts as carrying a Supply Crate Marker if it has any Supply.
                     * If there are no models within 20" of the Raider that have a Supply Crate Marker, then it will choose the closest as its target. If two or more models are equally close, the player can choose which model is its target.
                     * Ignore other Raider models when working out a Raider’s chosen target.


Moving the Raider
A player must move a Raider towards its target so that it finishes either in base contact with it, or if that is impossible, as close to its target as possible.


Attacking with the Raider
When the Raider attacks, it will target its target if it can do so. Otherwise, it will target the nearest model it can attack. If two or more potential targets are equally close to the Raider, the player can choose which model it attacks. When a Raider attacks, it makes a Melee Attack using its Improvised Weapon ability.

Abilities
                     * Thieving. The Raider has +1 DICE to Hit a model carrying a Supply Crate Marker, as well as the transport if it has any Supply. If the Raider Downs or takes an enemy Out of Action that was carrying a Supply Crate Marker, the Raider picks it up. If it causes any BLOOD MARKERS to the transport, and the transport has 1 or more Supply, reduce the Supply by 1 and give the Raider a Supply Crate Marker.
