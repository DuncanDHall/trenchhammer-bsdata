Harlequins Special Rules
Luck of the Laughing God. Once per battle for every 600 credits in your Warband’s limit, you can reroll any one Success Roll one of your HARLEQUIN models makes, or an Injury roll made against one of your HARLEQUIN models.


At the start of each battle, you can roll a number of D6s of your choice, up to a maximum of 6. If all of these rolls have a different result, you can use this special rule to reroll one additional roll for each of them. If any of them have the same result, you gain no additional rerolls.


Grand Performances. During a campaign, when you form your Warband, and each time you complete or abandon a Tale, select one of the Tales listed below. When you do, you begin the Rehearsal Phase of that Tale and can begin to satisfy its Requirements. You can complete these Requirements over the course of any number of battles. At any time before you complete all of your current Tale’s Rehearsal Phase requirements, you can abandon that Tale and begin the Rehearsal Phase of a different Tale.


Once you have completed all of the requirements of the Rehearsal Phase, you gain that Tale’s Rehearsal Rewards. Following this, you can begin the Grand Performance of that Tale at the start of any battle, though you do not have to. During that battle, you can gain Accolade points as described by the Tale’s Grand Performance section. At the end of that battle, after casualties, the Tale is complete, and you earn Grand Performance Rewards depending on how many Accolade points you earned during the battle.
