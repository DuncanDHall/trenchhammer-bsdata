# Drukhari

Drukhari Special Rules
Power From Pain. Some of your models have Pain(X) abilities. In order to use one of these abilities, you must spend X BLOOD MARKERS from among non-ARTIFICIAL enemy models. If there is not enough blood, you cannot use the ability.


Each of your DRUKHARI models always have the following Pain(X) abilities:
                  * Pain(1): Gain +1 DICE to a Dash Success Roll. Limit once per Success Roll.
                  * Pain(1): Gain +1 DICE to a Hit with any one attack. Limit once per Success Roll.


Territorial Dominance. During a campaign, after you create your Warband, choose one Archon, Haemonculus, or Succubus model to be your Ascendant Lord. Keep track of your Raid Spoils, beginning at 0. If your Ascendant Lord leaves your Warband for any reason, choose a different Archon, Haemonculus, or Succubus model to become your new Ascendant Lord, and reset your Raid Spoils to 0 (but they inherit all Territory).


At the start of each battle, before deployment, your opponent places a 1” Spoils marker anywhere on the battlefield that is not within a deployment zone, within 6” of a battlefield edge, or on Impassable Terrain or completely surrounded by it


As an Action with a Success Roll, any of your models in contact with this marker can attempt to recover that marker. On a success, it is carrying that marker. It can pass the marker to any ally it is within 1” of at the end of any of its Activations. If it is taken Out of Action, a model carrying a Spoils marker drops it at their previous position. At the end of each battle, you earn D3 Raid Spoils if one of your models is carrying the Spoils marker, and another D3 if you won the battle.


During any Trading step, you can purchase Territories for 1 Raid Spoil each. When you do, choose one of the following at random. You can instead spend 4 Raid Spoils to choose any result. While you control 3 or more territories of the same type, you gain their special ability.
                  1. Arena
                  * 3 or more: At the end of each battle, one Succubus or Elite Wych in your Warband earns 1 additional XP.
                  2. Docks
                  * 3 or more: Your opponent must place Spoils markers closer to your deployment zone than to their own.
                  3. Gang Territory
                  * 3 or more: At the end of each battle, during casualties, choose one:
                  * One Elite Reaver in your Warband earns 1 additional XP.
                  * Reroll one casualty roll for a Reaver.
                  4. Incubi Shrine
                  * 3 or more: At the end of each battle, during casualties, choose one:
                  * One Elite Incubus in your Warband earns 1 additional XP.
                  * Reroll one casualty roll for an Incubus.
                  5. Noble Spire
                  * 3 or more: While your Ascendant Lord is on the battlefield, your opponent has -1 DICE to all Morale tests.
                  6. Raidcraft Workshop
                  * 3 or more: At the end of each battle, during casualties, you can reroll any one casualty or Elite Trauma roll.
                  7. Scourge Spire
                  * 3 or more: At the end of each battle, during casualties, choose one:
                  * One Elite model with Scourge Wings in your Warband earns 1 additional XP.
                  * Reroll one casualty roll for a model with Scourge Wings.
                  8. Shadow District
                  * 3 or more: You can hire Mandrake Mercenaries for 3 Glory each.
                  9. Sprawl Slum
                  * 3 or more: Each time you spend a Raid Spoils point, roll one D6: on a 6, that Raid Spoils point is refunded.
                  10. Toxin Distillery
                  * 3 or more: Once per battle, you can give all melee attacks made by one of your DRUKHARI models GAS during one of its Activations.
                  11. Trading District
                  * 3 or more: Once per quartermaster step, you can purchase one piece of battlekit from your Campaign Shop.
                  12. Weapon Forge
                  * 3 or more: Weapons that cost 20 credits or more cost you 5 fewer credits. This affects both their cost to purchase and their cost for the purposes of credit limit.


You also gain another special benefit depending on your Ascendant Lord’s model type:
                  * Archon. If you win a battle against another Drukhari Warband, and your Ascendant Lord is an Archon, you can select one of their Territories. You gain that Territory and they lose it. If you win a battle against any other Warband, you earn 1 additional Raid Spoil.
                  * Haemonculus. If your Ascendant Lord is a Haemonculus, you can spend 1 Raid Spoils to ignore the result of any Elite Trauma or casualty roll for a Haemonculus, Wrack, Grotesque, Cronos, or Talos.
                  * Succubus. If your Ascendant Lord is a Succubus, it costs you only 2 Raid Spoils to choose an Arena Territory result.
Drukhari Patrons
Your patron must be Commorragh.
Patron: Commorragh
                  * Ancient Evil. While this model is on the battlefield and not Down, your opponent has -1 DICE to Morale tests. This effect does not stack.
                  * Deathly Perfectionist. Select any skill you want from the Ranged Skills.
                  * Famed Savagery. During Activations that this model has Charged, it gains +1 DICE to Hit and +1 INJURY DICE with melee attacks.
                  * Hatred Eternal. Injury rolls made against this model as a result of ranged attacks or psychic powers have -1 DICE.
                  * Labyrinthine Cunning. After you activate this model, you decide the next 3 models to activate, following the normal limits (i.e. the second will usually be your own model again). If you choose a model in a Fireteam, the model's owner decides if it will activate as a Fireteam or individually.
                  * Soul Thirst. Whenever this model takes an enemy Out of Action, remove 1 BLOOD MARKER from it.
