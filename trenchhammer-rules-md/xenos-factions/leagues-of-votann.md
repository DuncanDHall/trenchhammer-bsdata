# Leagues of Votann

Leagues of Votann Special Rules
Eye of the Ancestors. Whenever an enemy takes one of your non-ARTIFICIAL VOTANN models Out of Action, give that enemy 1 Grudge token. Any given model can have up to 2 Grudge tokens. Depending on how many Grudge tokens a model has, apply the following effects, which are cumulative.
                  * 1 Grudge Token. Your VOTANN models have +1 DICE to Hit that model with any of their attacks.
                  * 2 Grudge Tokens. Your VOTANN models have +1 INJURY DICE that model with any of their attacks.


Acquisitions. Keep track of the amount of each of the following Resources you have: Raw Minerals, Biomatter, Energy Sources, and Galactic Intel. At the end of each battle, you earn an amount of resources based on the credit limit of that battle:
                  * 899 or lower: D3x10
                  * 900-1199: D6x10
                  * 1200-1499: 2D6x10
                  * 1500+: 3D6x10


Roll a D6 to determine what type of resource you earn:
                  * 1. Raw Minerals
                  * 2. Biomatter
                  * 3. Energy Sources
                  * 4. Galactic Intel
                  * 5-6. Resource of your choice


During any Trade step, you can spend Resources to purchase any of the following Assets, which permanently apply to your Warband. You can purchase each Asset only once.
                  * Enhance Kindred Fleet (50 Raw Minerals, 50 Biomatter, 50 Energy Sources). At the end of each battle, you gain an additional D3x10 Energy Sources. In addition, you gain the Circle Back Exploration Skill.
                  * Equip Prospectors (50 Raw Minerals, 50 Biomatter, 50 Energy Sources, 50 Galactic Intel). Each time you roll to randomly determine a type of resource, you can roll two dice and choose one of the results to apply. In addition, you gain the Seek Exploration Skill.
                  * Establish Trade Routes (50 Raw Minerals, 50 Biomatter, X 50 Galactic Intel). Once per quartermaster step, you can trade up to 30 of one type of Resource for the same amount of one other Resource. In addition, you can sell battlekit for full price.
                  * Expand Mining Operations (100 Biomatter, 100 Energy Sources). At the end of each battle, you gain an additional D3x10 Raw Minerals. In addition, you gain the Extra Dice Exploration Skill.
                  * Honor Mercenary Contracts (50 Raw Minerals, 50 Biomatter, 50 Galactic Intel). Whenever one of your Mercenaries is a casualty, you regain half of its Glory cost, rounded down.
                  * Maintain Core Systems (50 Raw Minerals, 50 Energy Sources, 100 Galactic Intel). At the end of each battle, you gain an additional D3x10 Galactic Intel. In addition, you gain the Careful Exploration Skill.

Leagues of Votann Patrons
Your patron can be an Ancestor Core or a Guildmaster.
Patron: Ancestor Core
                  * A Long List. When this model takes an enemy that has one or more Grudge tokens Out of Action, you can give a Grudge token to any other enemy it can see, either within 18” of it or within 6” of the enemy model.
                  * Ancestral Power (Psyker Only). The range of all of this model’s psychic powers is increased by 6”.
                  * Bequest of the Votann. At the beginning of the battle, select any one Success Roll (aside from a Charge or a standard Melee/Ranged Attacks) by any enemy model. This Success Roll cannot target, affect or damage the Rightfully Guided model in any way.
                  * Grim Demeanor. This model and its VOTANN allies within 12” of it ignore the FEAR Keyword of enemies.
                  * Kinbond. This model may form a FIRETEAM with any one non-ELITE model of the Warband. In addition, the first time either model fails a Risky Success Roll during a Fireteam Activation, the Activation does not end.
                  * Warrior Lord. Injury rolls caused by the melee attacks of this model cannot have -DICE applied to them.
Patron: Guildmaster
                  * Ancestral Bearing. This model’s Actions, Abilities, and psychic powers can treat its allies as if they were 3” closer than they are.
                  * Experienced Eye. The cost of any suit of armour or equipment worth 15 credits or more is reduced by 5 credits if the model with this skill is part of the Warband. This does not stack.
                  * Guild Affiliate. At the end of each battle, you earn an additional D6x10 credits.
                  * Luck Has. Need Keeps. Toil Earns. This model has +1 DICE to all Success Rolls specific to the current mission, it counts as two models for the purpose of counting how many models you have within a certain location, and it counts as being worth 50 more credits for the purposes of any VP you earn. Finally, while this model is on the battlefield and not Down, it counts as an additional model for the purpose of morale (but it is not counted as 2 for your starting number of models).
                  * Master Armourer. This model’s armour increases by -1 if it is wearing any armour at all. This does not stack with shields.
                  * Unrelenting Toil. This model has +1 DICE to all Success Rolls besides attacks, Dash, or using psychic powers.
