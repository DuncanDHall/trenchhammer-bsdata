Slanni Special Rules
Cold Blooded. While your Warband is Shaken due to failing a Morale test, your models’ Success Rolls are not automatically Risky. Your Warband still makes a tactical retreat if it fails another Morale test while Shaken.


Divination of The Stars. During a campaign, your Warband is subject to goals dictated by the stars. Keep track of your Divination Points, beginning at 0. When you first create your Warband, randomly select two different Divinations from the following list. These are your Divinations for as long as the Warband exists.
                  1. Aeon Expedition. At the end of each battle, if one of your Elite models is in your opponent’s Deployment Zone, you earn 1 Divination Point.
                  2. Burning Bright. The first time during each battle that one of your Elite models scores a Glorious Deed, you earn 1 Divination Point.
                  3. Celestial Reclaimers. At the start of each battle, before deployment, your opponent places a 1” Star Relic marker anywhere on the battlefield that is not within a deployment zone, within 6” of a battlefield edge, or on Impassable Terrain or completely surrounded by it. As an Action without a Success Roll, any of your models in contact with the marker can pick up and carry that marker. It can pass the marker to any ally it is within 1” of at the end of any of its Activations. If it is taken Out of Action, a model carrying a Star Relic marker drops it at their previous position. You earn 1 Divination Point if one of your models is carrying the Star Relic at the end of the battle.
                  4. Divine Warriors. If you take at least half of the enemy models Out of Action, rounded up, during a battle, you earn 1 Divination Point.
                  5. Grand Triangulation. At the start of each battle, roll 3D6 and record each die’s result. At any point, if you control 3 SLANN models that are not Down, those models are not in your Deployment Zone, and they form a triangle with sides exactly 6” (+/- 0.25”) plus the result of each die, you earn 1 Divination Point. (For instance, if you rolled 2, 5, and 3, your models would need to be 8”, 11”, and 9” apart.)
                  6. Resonance Study. At the start of each battle, secretly note one enemy ELITE or TOUGH model. At the end of the battle, reveal your choice, and if that model was not Taken Out of Action, you earn 1 Divination.


Spending Divination Points
You can spend Divination Points in the following ways:
                  * Control Fate. When one of your Elite models would roll on the Elite Trauma table, you can spend 1 Divination to roll twice and choose one of the results. You must choose to do this before rolling.
                  * Expanded Consciousness. You can spend 2 Divination to grant one of your Elite models 1 XP.
                  * Fated Companion. When recruiting Mercenaries, you can spend Divination to reduce the Glory cost by 1 for every 3 Divination you spend.
                  * Star Destiny. After rolling Exploration Dice, you can reroll any one Exploration Die by spending 1 Divination. You can continue to do this as long as you have Divination to spend.
Slanni Patrons
Your patron must be a Great Mage.

                  * Dominating Mind (Psyker Only). This model has +1 DICE to Deny the Witch and enemies have -1 DICE to Deny the Witch against it.
                  * Higher State of Consciousness. After you activate this model, you decide the next 3 models to activate, following the normal limits (i.e. the second will usually be your own model again). If you choose a model in a Fireteam, the model's owner decides if it will activate as a Fireteam or individually.
                  * Lord of Celestial Resonance. This model begins the game with D3 BLESSING MARKERS.
                  * Thickly Scaled Hide. Injury rolls made against this model have -1, stacking with Armour and similar effects up to -3.
