# T'au Empire

T’au Empire Special Rules
For the Greater Good. When one of your models with the MARKERLIGHT keyword would make a ranged attack against an enemy, you can declare that it is attempting to mark that model instead of shooting it. Instead of taking an attack Success Roll, the target simply gains a Markerlight token. You cannot make multiple attacks or attack multiple targets with a weapon that normally allows you to in this way. The single Markerlight replaces all attacks with that weapon.


Ranged attacks against enemy models with at least one Markerlight token have +1 DICE to Hit. Your models can spend Markerlight tokens as if they were BLOOD MARKERS when making injury rolls for their ranged attacks. Remove all Markerlight tokens at the end of each Turn.


Expanding The Empire. During a campaign, when you create your Warband, or when you Convert a Demographic, choose one of the following Demographics to be your target (or roll randomly). You cannot choose a Demographic you have already Converted.
                  1. Brutal
                  * Conditions: Gain an Influence Point if you took at least half of the enemy models, rounded up, Out of Action.
                  * Reward: You earn 2 Glory.
                  2. Convicted
                  * Conditions: Gain an Influence Point if you succeeded on a Morale test, and/or if your opponent failed one.
                  * Reward: Each of your Elite models earns an additional 1 XP.
                  3. Downtrodden
                  * Conditions: At the start of the battle, your opponent places a 1” Supplies marker on the battlefield, at least 6” closer to your deployment zone than their own. At the end of the battle, if your opponent has more models within 3” of the Supplies marker than you, they earn 50 credits. If you have more models than your opponent within 3” of the Supplies marker at the end of the battle, you gain an Influence Point.
                  * Reward: Permanently increase your Model Limit for each battle by 2.
                  4. Logical
                  * Conditions: Gain an Influence Point if fewer than half of your models, rounded down, were taken Out of Action.
                  * Reward: Your credit limit is permanently increased by 50, and you earn 100 credits.
                  5. Prosperous
                  * Conditions: Gain an Influence Point if you won the battle, or scored at least ⅔ of the number of VP as your opponent.
                  * Reward: Your credit limit is permanently increased by 50, and you earn 100 credits.
                  6. Superstitious
                  * Conditions: Gain an Influence Point if one of your Elite models scored a Glorious Deed.
                  * Reward: Your Warband leader can choose to gain a Patron Skill the next time it has enough XP to learn a Campaign Skill, instead of rolling.


Keep track of your Influence Points, beginning at 0. At the end of each battle, you gain 1 Influence Point if you satisfied the conditions listed for your target Demographic.


Once you have 3 Influence Points, you have Converted your target Demographic and permanently gain that Demographic’s Reward, then reset your Influence Points to 0 and choose a new target Demographic. If you have fewer than 3 Influence Points, you can choose to abandon your current Demographic target and choose another, but your Influence Points reset to 0 if you do.
T’au Empire Patrons
Your patron must be an Ethereal Supreme.
Patron: Ethereal Supreme
                  * Academy Luminary. The model gains one of the Invocations listed for the Ethereal model. If it is an Ethereal, it cannot take the same Invocation twice.
                  * Exemplar Of The Kauyon. At the start of each battle, after deployment, you may redeploy this model and up to 2 of your other non-INFILTRATOR models, or 1 INFILTRATOR model.
                  * Exemplar Of The Mont’ka. This model has +1 INJURY DICE with ranged attacks that are not made at Long Range (regardless of the penalty actually applying).
                  * Precision Of The Hunter. All ranged attacks this model makes need 1 less BLOOD MARKER to cause a Bloodbath.
                  * Through Boldness, Victory. As an Action with no roll required, this model can choose itself or an ally within 12”. The chosen model can immediately move up to 3” towards any one enemy it can see. This movement can bring the model into melee combat, but counts as a Retreat if it moves away from an enemy.
                  * Through Unity, Devastation. This model and each ally within 6” of it gain CRITICAL on ranged attacks against targets with any Markelight tokens.
