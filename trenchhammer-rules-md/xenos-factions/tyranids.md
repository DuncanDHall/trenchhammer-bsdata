# Tyranids

Tyranids Special Rules
Shadow in the Warp. Enemy Warbands roll Morale Tests with -1 DICE when fighting a Tyranid Warband. Orks, Necrons, and T’au Empire Warbands as well as other Tyranid Warbands ignore this penalty.


In addition, while a Tyranid Warband is participating in a battle, Perils of the Warp do not apply to either side. Instead, models have a cumulative -2 DICE for each psychic power they have used during a given turn, instead of -1 DICE.


Synapse. Some Tyranid models have the SYNAPSE Keyword. While within 6” of a model with SYNAPSE, including itself, a model with the TYRANID Keyword is considered Within Synapse Range. A model Within Synapse Range has +1 DICE to Dash Actions.


Retrieve Biomass. During a campaign, whenever one of your TYRANID models is killed, whether from a casualty roll, receiving its third Battle Scar, or any other reason, you regain half of its credit cost, rounded up, and half of its Glory cost, rounded down.


In addition, if your opponent rolls the Captured result on the Elite Trauma table for any of their models, you cannot return that model to them, but you gain 50 credits if that model is not ARTIFICIAL, DAEMON, or NECRON. If it is also not a VEHICLE and has the LARGE Keyword, you earn 100 credits instead if it is LARGE. You earn half as many credits if the model is MECHANICUS.
Tyranids Patrons
Your patron must be The Hive Mind.
Patron: The Hive Mind
                  * Adaptive Biology. The model has NEGATE FIRE and NEGATE GAS.
                  * Alien Cunning. Enemy models never get free attacks against the model when it Retreats, and the model can move out of Melee Combat using its Standard Move, Charge, or Dash.
                  * Direct Guidance (Synapse Only). When the model activates, you can choose up to one other friendly non-Elite TYRANID model that is Within Synapse Range of it that has not yet activated during this Turn. Activate that model alongside this model as if they had the FIRETEAM Keyword. That model has +1 DICE to Hit with all attacks during this Activation.
                  * Heightened Reflexes. Once during each Turn, when an enemy model ends its movement within 12” of this model, this model can make a single ranged attack against that enemy.
                  * Synaptic Lynchpin. The model gains the SYNAPSE Keyword. If it already has SYNAPSE, instead allies are Within Synapse Range while they are within an additional 3” of this model.
                  * Synaptic Tendrils. The first time this model fails a Risky Success Roll during each of its Activations, its Activation continues instead of ending.
