# Necrons

Necron Special Rules
Reanimation Protocols. The first time each NECRON model you control would be taken Out of Action (or the second if it is TOUGH), it is treated as the Down result instead. Mark it as Reanimating. If the model has not been activated this Turn, it is considered to have done so. A Reanimating model cannot stand up or move for any reason.


At the start of a Reanimating model’s Activation, it can make a Success Roll. On a success, it is no longer Reanimating. On a failure, it remains Down and Reanimating, and its Activation ends. At the end of the battle, if it is still Reanimating, it makes one more Success Roll, and on a failure, it is taken Out of Action.


While a model is Reanimating, it can be attacked as normal, and Injury rolls made against it have an additional +1 DICE and ignore its Armour.


Dynastic Epithets. At the end of each battle, if your Warband leader scored at least one Glorious Deed and was not taken Out of Action, choose a new appropriately dramatic Epithet for it, inspired by that battle and its deed or a generally noble-sounding title. When you do, choose one of the following Dynastic Abilities for that model to gain. A model can have only up to five of these Abilities, but it can have any number of Epithets.
                  * Arch-Machinator. At the start of each mission, after deployment, you may redeploy up to 2 of your non-INFILTRATOR models, or 1 INFILTRATOR model.
                  * Arkane Collector. You can purchase one piece of equipment from the Campaign Shop, paying for it normally, but only this model can equip it.
                  * Dynastic Embodiment. You can recruit 1 additional Royal Warden.
                  * Lord Of Legions. Whenever one of your Necron Warriors is a casualty, you can recover one piece of battlekit from it.
                  * Loyal Servant. You immediately earn 1 Glory upon gaining this Dynastic Ability.
                  * Martial Perfectionist. You can purchase one weapon from the Campaign Shop, paying for it normally, but only this model can equip it.
                  * Restorer Of Empires. At the end of each battle, you earn D6x10 credits.
                  * Unflinchingly Regressive. At the end of each battle, if all enemy models were taken Out of Action, you earn 1 Glory (this is not a Glorious Deed).
Necron Patrons
Your patron must be a Dynasty Overlord.
Patron: Dynasty Overlord
                  * Enduring Will. A result of 7 on the Injury table counts as a Minor Hit against this model.
                  * Eternal Madness. Injury rolls caused by the melee attacks of this model cannot have -DICE applied to them.
                  * Honorable Combatant. This model has +1 DICE to Hit and +1 INJURY DICE with melee attacks against Elite enemies, but must attack an Elite target when making a melee attack if possible.
                  * Immortal Pride. Injuries caused by weapons that ignore armour or have ARMOUR PIERCING 2 (with or without a minimum) have -1 DICE against this model.
                  * Implacable Conqueror. When this model Charges, or a friendly NECRON model begins a Charge within 6” of it, roll 2D6 instead of 1D6 and then add the highest of the two dice to the charge move.
                  * Thrall of the Silent King. Once per game, this model can re-roll all the dice or any single die for one Success Roll, or an Injury roll it causes.

Battlekit
An Apprentek is always equipped with a Staff of Light, included in its cost and ignoring the normal restrictions. It can be equipped with any equipment from the Necrons Battlekit list. Its necrodermis provides it with -2 Armour, included above.


When you recruit an Apprentek, assign it to one of your Crypteks that has not had an Apprentek assigned to it. Depending on the Crytpek’s Discipline, the Apprentek has one of the following abilities:
                  * Chronomancer: Chronometron. As an Action with a Success Roll, the Apprentek can choose itself or one ally within 6” of it that it can see. On a success, all attacks against that model have -1 DICE to Hit until the end of the current Turn.
                  * Ethermancer: Lightning Field. As an Action with a Success Roll, the Ethermancer can choose itself or one ally within 6” of it that it can see. On a success, until the end of the current Turn, after each time an enemy model makes a melee attack against that model, the attacker suffers a STUN MARKER.
                  * Geomancer: Seismic Crucible. As an Action with a Success Roll, the Geomancer can cause the earth to shake around it. On a success, each other model within 6” of the Geomancer must roll on the Injury table, ignoring Armour and with +1 INJURY DICE, suffers STUN MARKERS instead of BLOOD MARKERS from that Injury roll and treats results of Out of Action as Down instead.
                  * Plasmancer: Living Lightning. As an Action with a Success Roll, the Apprentek can choose one enemy within 8” of it. On a success, that enemy gets D3 STUN MARKERS.
                  * Psychomancer: Veil of Darkness. As an Action with a Success Roll, the Apprentek can attempt to vanish and reappear elsewhere. If successful, choose a location within 8” that is not on or entirely surrounded by Impassable Terrain. Remove the Psychomancer from the battlefield and place it back on the battlefield at that point.
                  * Technomancer: Reinforce Metal. As an Action with a Success Roll, the Apprentek can choose itself or one ally within 6” of it that it can see. On a success, all Injury rolls made against that model have -1 DICE until the end of the current Turn.
