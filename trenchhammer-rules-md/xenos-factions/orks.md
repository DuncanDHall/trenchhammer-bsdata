Ork Special Rules
Waaagh! Once per battle, at the start of any Turn, you can declare a Waaagh! For the duration of that Turn, the Waaagh! Is active, providing the following benefits:
                  * When one of your ORK models charges, roll 2D6 instead of 1D6 and then add the highest of the two dice to their charge move.
                  * Your ORK models’ melee attacks have +1 DICE to Hit.
                  * Injuries rolled against any of your ORK models have -1 DICE.


Stomp ‘Em Good. During a campaign, keep track of your Stompin’ Points, beginning at 0 with a maximum of 50. You gain Stompin’ Points for the following accomplishments:
                  * Braggin’ Rights. +1 Stompin’ Point if you scored any Glorious Deeds during a battle.
                  * Winnin’. +2 Stompin’ Points if you win a battle.
                  * Da Boss. +2 Stompin’ Points if you take the enemy Warband leader Out of Action.
                  * Legand. +5 Stompin’ Points each time one of your Elite models reaches 15 XP.
                  * New Warboss. -20 Stompin’ Points (minimum 0) if your Warband leader is removed from your Warband for any reason.
                  * Momentum. At the end of each battle, you gain Stompin’ Points depending on the Stage your WAAAGH! is in (see below).
                  * Speshul. At the start of each battle, choose one of the following special ways you can gain Stompin’ Points:
                  * Overwhelming Aggression. At the end of the battle, if there are more of your ORK models on the battlefield than there are enemy models, you gain 2 Stompin’ Points.
                  * Scrag Da Killiest Git. At the start of the battle, identify the enemy model with the highest cost in credits, counting each 1 Glory as 30 credits. If you take that enemy model Out of Action during the battle, you gain 2 Stompin’ Points.
                  * Scrap ‘Em. If you took at least one enemy VEHICLE model Out of Action during the battle, you gain 2 Stompin’ Points.
                  * Show ‘Em How It’s Done. If your Warband leader took a TOUGH enemy model Out of Action, you gain 2 Stompin’ Points.


Depending on how many Stompin’ Points you have, your WAAAGH! is in one of the following Stages. Each Stage has special rules you must follow, and is updated after all Stompin’ Points are added from a battle.
                  * 0-9 Stompin’ Points: Gathering WAAAGH!
                  * Stompin’ Points. At the end of each battle, you gain 1 Stompin’ Point.

                  * 10-24 Stompin’ Points: Escalating WAAAGH!
                  * Stompin’ Points. At the end of each battle, you gain 1 Stompin’ Point.
                  * Orky Ructions. After each battle, take a Ruction test, with -1 DICE if you lost that battle.
                  * ‘Eads Together. One of your Elite models earns an additional 1 XP at the end of each battle.

                  * Stompin’ Points. You do not gain any Stompin’ Points at the end of each battle. You are at the limit!

                  * Massive WAAAGH! At the end of each battle, you earn 2 Glory.
Orky Ructions
At the end of each battle, after casualties, depending on your current WAAAGH! Stage, you might be required to take a Ruction test. To do so, make a Success Roll with +1 DICE, modified further as described in your current Stage. If the Success Roll succeeds, nothing happens. If it fails, one of the following occurs:
                  * If the result on the dice did not show doubles, you must choose to either suffer a Minor Ruction, or reduce your Stompin’ Points by 10 (minimum 0). If you choose a Minor Ruction, roll a D6 and consult the following table:
                  1. Unruly Mobs. Choose two of your Elite models. Randomly choose one to roll on the Elite Trauma table. The other earns 1 XP.
                  2. Reckless Meks. If you have at least one ORK VEHICLE model in your Warband, choose one at random. Otherwise, choose one Big Mek or Mek in your Warband at random. The chosen model must roll a casualty test, or on the Elite Trauma table if it is Elite. If you have no ORK VEHICLES, Big Meks, or Meks, nothing happens.
                  3. Impatient Irritability. During your next battle, when you use your Waaagh! special rule, randomly select one of the three benefits. You do not gain that benefit during this battle.
                  4. Thievin' Gits. Randomly select one piece of battlekit in your roster that costs Glory. If you do not have any such pieces of battlekit, randomly choose the piece of battlekit in your roster that costs the most credits, rolling randomly for a tie. You cannot use the chosen piece of battlekit during your next battle.
                  5. Rowdy Yoofs. During the next Exploration phase, you earn half as many credits from your roll as normal. This has no effect if you Reinforce, and does not affect any credits gained from your Exploration’s result; only the roll.
                  6. Confrazzled By Mind Monsters. One random ORK PSYKER model from your Warband must roll on the Elite Trauma chart.
                  * If the result on the dice showed doubles, you must choose to either suffer a Major Ruction, or reduce your Stompin’ Points by 15 (minimum 0). If you choose a Major Ruction, roll a D6 and consult the following table:
                  1. Ruckus In Da Ranks. One random Elite model in your Warband suffers a Battle Scar (with no associated Trauma).
                  2. External Combustion Test. Each ORK VEHICLE, Mek, or Big Mek in your Warband must roll a casualty test, or on the Elite Trauma table if it is Elite.
                  3. Last Boss Standin’. Randomly choose one of your non-LEADER Elite models, then roll a D6. On a 1-2, your Warband leader gains a Battle Scar. On a 3-6, the chosen model gains a Battle Scar. Repeat this process until one of them is killed. These Battle Scars have no associated Trauma.
                  4. Unstable Discharge. Reduce your Stompin’ Points by 10, then one random ORK PSYKER model from your Warband must roll on the Elite Trauma chart.
                  5. Fizzlin’ Momentum. During your next battle, when you use your Waaagh! special rule, randomly select one of the three benefits. You only gain that benefit during this battle, and not the other two.
                  6. Lost In Da Warp. You must Reinforce during this post-battle phase. You cannot Explore, nor can you choose to do neither.
