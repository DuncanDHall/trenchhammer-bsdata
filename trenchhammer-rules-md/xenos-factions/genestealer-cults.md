# Genestealer Cults

Genestealer Cults Special Rules
Cult Ambush. At the start of the battle, before deployment, choose up to half of your GENESTEALER CULTS models, rounded up, to be waiting to Ambush. Those models gain DEEP STRIKE, but are deployed with this Keyword in a special way.


After normal deployment, place four 32mm Cult Ambush markers on the battlefield, each at least 8” away from any enemy model, and not within line of sight of any enemy. Your models in waiting to Ambush can be deployed using their DEEP STRIKE keyword only within 3” of one of your Cult Ambush markers, and more then 1” away from all enemies, instead of the normal restrictions, and are not adjusted by D3”.


Infiltration. During a campaign, when you create your Warband, or when you gain control of an Institution, choose one of the following Institutions to be your target or roll randomly. You cannot choose an Institution that you already Control.
                  1. Community
                  * Conditions: Gain an Infiltration Point if fewer than half of your models, rounded down, were taken Out of Action.
                  * Reward: Permanently increase your Model Limit for each battle by 2.
                  2. Industry
                  * Conditions: Gain an Infiltration Point if you won the battle, or scored at least ⅔ of the number of VP as your opponent.
                  * Reward: Your credit limit is permanently increased by 50, and you earn 100 credits.
                  3. Military
                  * Conditions: Gain an Infiltration Point if you took at least half of the enemy models, rounded up, Out of Action.
                  * Reward: Each of your Elite models earns an additional 1 XP.
                  4. Politics
                  * Conditions: Gain an Infiltration Point if one of your Elite models scored a Glorious Deed.
                  * Reward: Your Warband leader can choose to gain a Patron Skill the next time it has enough XP to learn a Campaign Skill, instead of rolling.
                  5. Religion
                  * Conditions: Gain an Infiltration Point if you succeeded on a Morale test, and/or if your opponent failed one.
                  * Reward: You earn 2 Glory.
                  6. Resources
                  * Conditions: At the start of the battle, your opponent places a 1” Resource marker on the battlefield, at least 6” closer to your deployment zone than their own. At the end of the battle, if your opponent has more models within 3” of the Resource marker than you, they earn 50 credits. If you have more models than your opponent within 3” of the Resource marker at the end of the battle, you gain an Infiltration Point.
                  * Reward: During this or any future quartermaster step, you can purchase up to two total pieces of battlekit from your Campaign Shop.


Keep track of your Infiltration Points, beginning at 0. At the end of each battle, you gain 1 Infiltration Point if you satisfied the conditions listed for your target Institution.


Once you have 3 Infiltration Points, you gain Control of your target Institution and permanently gain that Institution’s Reward, then reset your Infiltration Points to 0 and choose a new target Institution. If you have fewer than 3 Infiltration Points, you can choose to abandon your current Institution target and choose another, but your Infiltration Points reset to 0 if you do.
