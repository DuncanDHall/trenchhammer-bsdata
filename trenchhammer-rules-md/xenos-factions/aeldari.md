# Aeldari

Aeldari Special Rules
Battle Focus. At the start of each Turn, for every 300 credits in your Warband’s credit limit, you gain 1 Focus Point. You can spend these points on any of the following effects. At the end of the Turn, all unspent Focus Points are lost.
               * Fall Back. When one of your AELDARI models Retreats, you can prevent enemies from making free attacks against it.
               * Flitting Shadows. Before a ranged attack is made against one of your AELDARI models, you can give it STEALTH until the end of that Activation.
               * Opportunity Seized. After an enemy Retreats from one of your AELDARI models, that AELDARI model can immediately move up to 3” if it is not in close combat with any enemies. This movement cannot bring it within 1” of any enemy.
               * Star Engines. When one of your AELDARI VEHICLE models moves, you can increase its movement speed by 3” until the end of that movement.
               * Sudden Strike. When one of your AELDARI models Charges, you can reroll the charge die.
               * Swift as the Wind. You can add +1 DICE to any Dash Success Roll one of your AELDARI models makes.


Guiding Fate. During a campaign, when you create your Warband and after each of your Threads of Fate have ended, successfully or not, generate 3 Threads of Fate by rolling on the following table (rerolling all duplicates), and keep track of your Threat, beginning at 1 (or resetting to 1).
               1. Cleanse The Corruption
               2. Destined Device
               3. Enemy Of My Enemy
               4. Humble Beginnings
               5. Isha’s Bounty
               6. Rising Nemesis


Each Thread of Fate has three stages: Dawning, Waning, and Frayed. Each begins at Dawning, and advances to the next stage every time it escalates. If a Frayed Thread of Fate escalates, it ends in failure instead.


At the start of any battle, you can choose one of your Threads of Fate that has not ended. That Thread of Fate is active during that battle, and if you complete all of the requirements of its current stage by the end of the battle, it is ended successfully and you can lower your Threat by an amount based on the current stage of that Thread of Fate: 3 for Dawning, 2 for Waning, 1 for Frayed, to a minimum of 0. If you do not complete the requirements, that Thread of Fate escalates.


At the end of each battle, after lowering Threat if you successfully ended a Thread of Fate, increase your Threat by D3, or by 3 if you lost the battle. If your Threat ever reaches 13 or higher, all Threads of Fate automatically end in failure, even if you ended any of them successfully before.


Once all of your Threads of Fate have ended, successfully or in failure, you gain rewards and/or penalties based on your current Threat.
               * 0-4 Threat: Brief Respite
               * You gain 3 Glory

               * You gain 1 Glory
