# New Keywords

ARMOUR PIERCING X
As the base ARMOUR PIERCING Keyword, but weapons with this Keyword ignore -X worth of Armour.
BURROW
When moving, a model with BURROW can ignore Difficult and Impassable Terrain, as well as enemies, but it cannot end its movement inside of or surrounded by Impassable Terrain, and cannot end within close combat of an enemy unless it is Charging that enemy nor leave close combat without Retreating. Its movement also ignores Dangerous Terrain unless it ends that movement in contact with it.


A model with BURROW and FLYING can use only one at a time, choosing for each movement.
DEEP STRIKE
Models with this Keyword are initially kept off the battlefield and can be deployed later. These models still count towards the number of models you have on the battlefield for purposes of who activates first, and for morale.


You can choose not to set up any model with this Keyword at the start of the battle. At the start of any turn after the first, so long as you have at least one other model on the battlefield, you can place any of those models anywhere on the table at least 8” away from the closest enemy, or anywhere within your deployment zone that is not in close combat with any enemy.


After each model is placed in this way, your opponent then adjusts it D3” from its current location, horizontally in the direction of their choice. Ignore terrain and other models when doing this, but it cannot end this placement in Impassable Terrain or surrounded by it, stopping at the closest legal location. If multiple levels of terrain are available at that horizontal location, such as a building with an interior and a roof, you choose which surface the model ends up on.


During its first Turn on the battlefield, a model placed using DEEP STRIKE cannot take any Actions specific to the current mission or interact with any special mission objects or objectives, it cannot leave the battlefield of its own accord, and it does not count when determining control of any objectives or for the purposes of any scoring except by your opponent.


If you and your opponent each have models with this Keyword, alternate placing them, beginning with the player with the most total models. If a player chooses not to place one of these models, they cannot place any more during that Turn. i.e. they cannot see what their opponent places then change their mind.


If you choose not to place a model in this way that you kept off the battlefield for the entire battle, it does not count as having participated in the battle.
DEEP STRIKE (TUNNEL)
A model with this keyword uses the rules for DEEP STRIKE, but cannot be placed on any overhanging terrain or on top of any building with an interior (even if only imagined). Essentially, it must come up from the ground.
Faction Keywords

HELD
A weapon can have the HELD property, causing it to take up a hand, or two hands for a TWO-HANDED weapon, for both ranged and melee.


A model with STRONG can wield a TWO-HANDED HELD weapon in one hand for melee, allowing it to carry another melee weapon, but it still takes up both hands for ranged. CUMBERSOME prevents this.
LARGE
Models with this Keyword are larger than other models, typically standing on 40mm bases. They are not affected by certain abilities or effects due to their size.


(This keyword replaces the rules for effects that do not work on models on bases larger than 32mm.)
LIMITED POTENTIAL
Models with this Keyword can learn only up to 3 skills from gaining XP if they are, or become, Elite.
MAIN HAND ONLY
This weapon cannot be used to make off-hand attacks.
NONLETHAL
Injury rolls caused by this weapon treat Out of Action results as Down results instead.
NO PROMOTION
Models with this Keyword cannot be promoted to Elite during a campaign.
PERILOUS +/-X
A psychic power with this Keyword causes the caster to suffer Perils of the Warp on rolls of 2 to X higher than 2, and X lower than 12 to 12. PERILOUS always stacks with itself.


Example: A power with PERILOUS ±2 causes Perils of the Warp on a roll of 2-4 and 10-12.
PSYCHIC
PSYCHIC is a Keyword that can apply to Abilities and attacks, and all psychic powers have it by default.
PSYKER X
A model with PSYKER is capable of using psychic powers. The X value is the number of +DICE it adds when using psychic powers. It can use its X value in place of Ranged or Melee Skill when attacking with a PSYCHIC weapon.
STEALTH
Long Range attacks against a model with this Keyword suffer an additional -1 DICE to Hit. Attacks that ignore Long Range penalties also ignore this Keyword.
STUN
A weapon with STUN causes a STUN MARKER in addition to the normal result of its injury roll, even if no BLOOD MARKER was gained. If it also has STUN MARKERS, this is in addition to the normal STUN MARKERS.
STUN MARKERS
A weapon with STUN MARKERS causes STUN MARKERS instead of BLOOD MARKERS, including via other Keywords or Abilities.
SWARM
A model with this Keyword is made up of many tiny creatures. It cannot fall Down for any reason, but weapons with the BLAST Keyword have +1 INJURY DICE against it, as they strike all of the creatures at once.
SWEEPING
When a model armed with a SWEEPING weapon takes a Fight Action, you can make 1 Melee Attack against each enemy model with 1” of the attacking model. Resolve each Melee Attack one at a time in the order of your choice.
THROWN
This battlekit takes up no hands, but a model can be equipped with only one THROWN piece of battlekit at a time.
VICIOUS X
This weapon scores a Critical Hit on any roll of X or higher, if it otherwise would hit.
WHIP X”
A melee weapon with this keyword can be used to make a ranged attack with a range of X inches, with IGNORE LONG RANGE. Such attacks use the model’s Melee Skill. It still counts as a melee weapon for the purpose of hands used.
