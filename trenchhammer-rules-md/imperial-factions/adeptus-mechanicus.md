# Adeptus Mechanicus

Adeptus Mechanicus Special Rules
Canticles of the Omnissiah. At the start of each Turn, choose one of the following Canticles. That Canticle applies until the start of the next Turn. You cannot choose the same Canticle twice in a row. Alternatively, you can choose a Canticle randomly, in which case it can be the same Canticle as the previous one.
         1. Benediction of the Omnissiah. Your MECHANICUS models can reroll one die during each Success Roll they take to Hit with a ranged attack.
         2. Chant of the Remorseless Fist. When one of your MECHANICUS models hits an enemy in melee, you can reroll one INJURY DIE.
         3. Invocation of Machine Vengeance. Your MECHANICUS models have +1 DICE when taking the Dash Success Roll.
         4. Incantation of the Iron Soul. You gain +1 DICE to Morale Tests made for your Warband.
         5. Litany of the Electromancer. Your MECHANICUS models have BLOCK.
         6. Shroudpsalm. Your MECHANICUS models have STEALTH. Any model that already has STEALTH replaces the effects of that keyword with: Enemies have -1 DICE to hit this model with ranged attacks.


The Search For Archeotech. During a campaign, at the start of each battle, before deployment, your opponent places a 1” Archeotech marker anywhere on the battlefield that is not within a deployment zone, within 6” of a battlefield edge, or on Impassable Terrain or completely surrounded by it


As an Action with a Success Roll, any of your models in contact with the marker can attempt to recover that marker. On a success, it is carrying that marker. It can pass the marker to any ally it is within 1” of at the end of any of its Activations. If it is taken Out of Action, a model carrying an Archeotech marker drops it at their previous position.


At the end of the battle, if one of your models is carrying an Archeotech marker, you have recovered a piece of Archeotech. Add it to your reserves. Roll a D6 to determine its type:
         * 1-3. Power Source
         * 4. Weapon Part
         * 5. Force Field Part
         * 6. Techno-Arcana


Then roll a D6 to determine its precise nature:

	Restrained Vortex

Reconstructing Archeotech
By combining a Power Source with a Weapon Part, Force Field Part, or Techno-Arcana, you can create a piece of functioning Archeotech battlekit. The effect of this piece of battlekit is determined by the Weapon Part, Force Field Part, or Techno-Arcana, with an additional modification based on the Power Source.


Any of your non-Mercenary MECHANICUS models can be equipped with Archeotech. A model can be equipped with only up to 1 Archeotech Weapon, 1 Archeotech Force Field, and 1 Archeotech Techno-Arcana.


You can sell functioning pieces of Archeotech battlekit for 1 Glory apiece.


Archeotech Weapons

         * Arc Annulus. 18”, if the target would have an armour modifier from any source other than a shield, you may set one die of the injury roll to a 6 before the roll is made. The rest of the dice for the injury roll are rolled as normal. Takes no hands, but can be used only once per battle.
         * Electro-Fused Vambraces. 18” (always uses ranged skill), ASSAULT, STUN, PISTOL, takes no hands, but can be used only once per battle.
         * Digital Cannon. 24”, +1 INJURY DICE, takes no hands, but can be used only once per battle.


Weapon Power Sources
         * Restrained Vortex. The weapon gains BLAST 3”. The wielder is never hit due to this Keyword.
         * Spatial Alternator. On a hit, the target must also move D3” in the direction of your choice, including falling, free attack from leaving melee, etc.
         * Teleportation Matrix. Immediately after a hit with the weapon, if the target is still on the battlefield, the wielder can teleport to anywhere within 1” of the target that is not within 1” of any other enemy.
         * Acidic Conductor. The weapon has VICIOUS 10.
         * Endothermic Reactor. A target hit by the weapon has half movement during its next Activation.
         * Induction Node. A target hit by the weapon has -1 DICE to hit with all attacks until the end of its next Activation.


Archeotech Force Fields
         * Void Shell. Once per battle, the bearer can treat one Down Injury result as a Minor Hit instead. This does not apply to Down results that already replaced another result, such as with TOUGH.
         * Arc Implants. When an enemy successfully Charges the bearer, that enemy gains 1 STUN MARKER.
         * Time Sink. Once per battle, as an Action that requires no roll, the bearer can choose one enemy it can see within 12” that has not activated this Turn. That enemy cannot activate until your opponent has activated D3 other models, or until there is no choice.
         * Conversion Eradicator. When the bearer is taken Out of Action, one enemy within 12” of it suffers 1 BLOOD MARKER.
         * Inverse Power Feeds. The bearer’s melee attacks score a Critical Hit on a roll of 11 or higher.
         * Technodermis. Once per battle, the bearer can apply -1 DICE to one Injury roll made against it.


Force Field Power Sources
         * Restrained Vortex. Any enemy that Charges the bearer has -1 DICE to Hit it with melee attacks until the end of the Turn.
         * Spatial Alternator. The bearer has +1” to its movement speed.
         * Teleportation Matrix. When the bearer takes the Dash Success Roll, it can ignore terrain and enemy models during that movement.
         * Acidic Conductor. Melee attacks against the bearer lose the ARMOUR PIERCING 1 Keyword. This does not affect ARMOUR PIERCING 2 or IGNORE ARMOUR.
         * Endothermic Reactor. When an enemy Charges the bearer, subtract 2” from its movement during that Charge.
         * Induction Node. Once per battle, the bearer can gain +1 DICE to Hit with one attack it makes.


Archeotech Techno-Arcanas
         * Obscuroptikon. While the Shroudpsalm Canticle is active, this techn-arcana is also active.
         * Exo-Gauntlet. While the Chant of the Remorseless Fist Canticle is active, this techn-arcana is also active.

Techno-Arcana Power Sources
         * Restrained Vortex. While this techno-arcana is active, +DICE cannot be added to Injuries caused by melee attacks against the bearer or any of its allies within 6”, except due to spending BLOOD MARKERS and INFECTION MARKERS.
         * Spatial Alternator. While this techno-arcana is active, enemies have -1 DICE to hit the bearer and any of its allies within 6” of the bearer with ranged attacks.
         * Teleportation Matrix. While this techno-arcana is active, the bearer and any of its allies within 6” of it always Charge the full 12”, regardless of the roll or any penalties to Charge distance. Other effects such as Difficult Terrain still apply.
         * Acidic Conductor. While this techno-arcana is active, increase the range of all non-THROWN ranged weapons the bearer and any of its allies within 6” of it wield by 6”.
         * Endothermic Reactor. While this techno-arcana is active, enemy models never get free attacks against the bearer or any of its allies within 6” when they Retreat, and the the bearer and any of its allies within 6”  can move out of Melee Combat using their Standard Move, Charge, or Dash.
