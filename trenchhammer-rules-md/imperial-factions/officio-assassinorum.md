# Officio Assassinorum

 r/Warhammer40k - Can you make an army out of the Officio Assassinorum? If so, what would be a good baseline set up for them be?

Officio Assassinorum Special Rules
Execution Force. Your Warband does not have a leader. Instead, you must include at least one Elite model, and whenever an effect specifies your warband leader, you must choose any one of your Elite models for it to affect.


Assassination Targets. At the start of each battle, secretly choose one of your Elite models and one of your opponent’s Elite models. If your chosen Elite model takes their chosen Elite model Out of Action during that battle, your chosen model earns 1 additional XP. If it does not, your chosen model earns 1 fewer XP from that battle.
Officio Assassinorum Patrons
Your patron must be the Grand Master of Assassins.
Patron: Grand Master of Assassins
Or a similar high-ranking member of the Officio Assasinorum.
               * Ensnaring Traps. Whenever an enemy model successfully Charges this model, that enemy suffers 1 BLOOD MARKER.
               * Extremis Sanction: Melee. All melee attacks this model makes need 1 less BLOOD MARKER to cause a Bloodbath.
               * Extremis Sanction: Ranged. All ranged attacks this model makes need 1 less BLOOD MARKER to cause a Bloodbath.
               * Perfect Reflexes: Pounce. Once during each Turn, when an enemy ends its movement within 6” of this model, this model may immediately Charge that enemy.
               * Perfect Reflexes: Snapshot. Once during each Turn, when an enemy ends its movement within 6” of this model, this model may immediately make a single ranged attack against that enemy, if it is otherwise able to do so.
               * Will-Sapping Salvo. Whenever this model hits with a ranged attack, the target also suffers a STUN MARKER.
