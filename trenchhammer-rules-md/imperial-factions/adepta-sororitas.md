# Adepta Sororitas

  Adepta Sororitas Special Rules
Miracles. You have a pool of Miracles, beginning at 0 at the start of each battle.


You gain Miracles in the following circumstances:
* Slay. Whenever one of your SORORITAS models takes an Elite enemy model Out of Action, you gain 1 Miracle.
* Martyr. Whenever one of your Elite SORORITAS models is taken Out of Action, you gain 1 Miracle.
* Hold. Whenever you succeed at a Morale test, you gain 1 Miracle.


You can spend Miracles as if they were BLESSING MARKERS on any of your SORORITAS models.


Sacred Martyrdom. Whenever one of your Elite models is killed for any reason, such as receiving a third Battle Scar, you earn 1 Glory. You earn an additional 1 Glory if the model had 10 or more XP, as well as an additional 1 Glory if it was a Saint Potentia.


Saint Potentia. During a campaign, when you create your warband, choose one Elite model to be your Saint Potentia. At the start of each battle, you may choose a Trial your Saint Potentia has not completed. The Saint Potentia completes its Trial once it satisfies the listed Requirements of that Trial during battles in which that Trial was chosen, at which point it permanently gains the listed Reward for that Trial. The requirements do not need to be satisfied during the same battle, and can be completed in any order.


In the event that your Saint Potentia completes all five Trials, it becomes a Living Saint (it remains your Saint Potentia). Remove all Traumas and Battle Scars from it. It no longer rolls on the Elite Trauma Table after a battle where it was taken Out of Action. In addition, all Injury rolls made against it have -1 DICE.


If your Saint Potentia leaves your Warband for any reason, choose a different Elite model to become your new Saint Potentia during your next Reinforcements Step. You can choose a newly recruited model.

When recruited, a Battle Sister can be given one of the following upgrades.
* Mortisanctus. Up to 1 Battle Sister can be upgraded to a Mortisanctus for +5 credits, granting it +1 Melee Skill and allowing it to ignore the HEAVY Keyword of one melee weapon it wields (though not the TWO-HANDED Keyword), but it has -1 to its Ranged Skill (total +0).

* Sacresant. Up to 2 Battle Sisters, or 3 in a Warband of 1,200 credits or more, can be upgraded to Sacresants for +10 credits each, granting them +1 Melee Skill and the following ability:
   * Bodyguard. If any ally within 1” of the Sacresant is hit by a ranged or melee weapon (excluding BLAST weapons), you can choose to redirect the hit to the Sacresant instead. Determine the injuries exactly as if the weapon just hit the Sacresant.
* Seraphim. Up to 2 Battle Sisters can be upgraded to Seraphim for +15 credits each, allowing them to be equipped with Jump Packs (purchased separately). While equipped with a Jump Pack, a Seraphim has the SKIRMISHER Keyword, and while armed with Ranged Weapons with the PISTOL Keyword in addition to a Jump Pack, it has the following benefits:
   * If it is equipped with 2 Weapons with the PISTOL Keyword, it can take a Shoot ACTION with one and then immediately take a Shoot ACTION with the other.

If you do, it is considered the same model for purposes of the post-game sequence, and it permanently gains the NEGATE FEAR Keyword in place of its Penitence of Cowardice ability. You can purchase an upgrade for it as if it was just recruited if it does not already have one. It is eligible for promotion immediately.

Warband Variant: Army of Faith
* The Faithful. You cannot take any Penitent Engines, and only up to 2 Repentia.
* Angelic Descent. You can upgrade only up to 1 Battle Sister to a Retributor and up to 1 to a Sacresant, but you can upgrade up to 3 Battle Sisters to Seraphim and up to 3 to Zephyrim.
* Blinding Radiance. When an attack is made against one of your models with a Jump Pack or one of its allies within 3”, you can spend 1 Miracle to cause that attack to suffer -1 DICE to Hit. Further ranged attacks made during this Turn against the model with the Jump Pack or one of its allies with 3” of it have -1 DICE.

Warband Variant: Hallowed Martyrs

* Blood of Martyrs. You earn 1 Miracle each time one of your non-Elite SORORITAS models is taken Out of Action, but you do not earn any Miracles for taking an enemy Elite model Out of Action, and you cannot spend Miracles on Injury rolls made against your models.
* Spirit of the Martyr. When one of your SORORITAS models would be taken Out of Action, you can spend 1 Miracle to allow it to make a single melee attack before being removed from the battlefield. BLOOD MARKERS cannot be spent on this attack.
* Divine Intervention. When one of your ELITE SORORITAS models is taken Out of Action, you can spend 3 Miracles to treat it as a Down result instead. You can do this only once during each battle, and not if you already used Spirit of the Martyr for this Out of Action.

Warband Variant: Penitent Host

   * Overseer of Redemption. Each Repentia within 3” of the Canoness has +1 DICE to Hit with all melee attacks.
   * Penitents. You can recruit any number of Repentia and up to 2 Penitent Engines, and you can recruit up to 5 Arco-Flagellant Mercenaries for 70 credits each. You cannot recruit any Novitiates or Paragon Warsuits, and you can recruit Battle Sisters only via your Repentias’ Repentance ability. In a one-off game, you can recruit up to 1 Battle Sister.
   * Vows of Atonement. Instead of the Miracles special rule, at the start of each Turn, choose one of the following benefits to apply until the end of that Turn:
   * Absolution in Battle. Your Repentia, Arco-Flagellants, and Penitent Engines have +1 INJURY DICE with melee attacks made during an Activation in which they Charged.
   * Death Before Disgrace. When one of your Repentia, Arco-Flagellants, or Penitent Engines is taken Out of Action, before removing it from the table, it can make a single melee attack against an enemy it is in close combat with.
