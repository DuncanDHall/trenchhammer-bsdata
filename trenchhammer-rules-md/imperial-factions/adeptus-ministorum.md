# Adeptus Ministorum

Adeptus Ministorum Special Rules
Battle Hymns. At the start of each Turn, choose one of the following Hymns. That Hymn is being spoken by each of your ORATOR models during that Turn, so long as it is not Down. Each ORATOR and each friendly ECCLESIARCHY model within 6” of it have the benefits of the chosen Hymn.
            * The Emperor Protects. The armour of affected models have IMPERVIOUS, and -DICE can always be applied to Injury roll against them even if another rule would prevent this.
            * The Emperor’s Strength. Affected models have ARMOUR PIERCING 1 with all of their melee attacks, stacking with other sources of ARMOUR PIERCING.
            * The Righteousness of the Emperor. Affected models have +1 DICE to Hit with ranged attacks that are made against targets within half the attack’s maximum range (this still applies only at half range even if the attack ignores Long Range or hits automatically).


Rally the Flock. During a campaign, keep a running total of your Flock points, beginning at 0. You earn Flock points in the following ways:
            * Defend the Holy Land. At the end of each battle, if there are no enemy models in your deployment zone, you earn 1 Flock.
            * Despise the Enemy. At the end of each battle, if you took at least half of the enemy models Out of Action, you earn 1 Flock.
            * Never Cease. At the end of each battle, if at all times during that battle you had at least one ORATOR model on the battlefield that was not Down, you earn 1 Flock.
            * Show Your Faith. The first time one of your Elite models, or your Miraculist, scores a Glorious Deed during each battle, you earn 1 Flock.
            * Spread the Holy Word. The first time one of your ORATOR models ends a Turn in the enemy deployment zone while it is not Down, you earn 1 Flock.


Spending Flock Points
You can spend your Flock points in the following ways:
            * Gather. When recruiting Mercenaries, you can spend Flock Points to reduce the Glory cost by 1 for every 5 Flock you spend.
            * Pray. When one of your Elite models would roll on the Elite Trauma table, you can spend 2 Flock to roll twice and choose one of the results. You must choose to do this before rolling.
            * Replace. When one of your non-Elite, non-Mercenary models becomes a casualty, you can spend 1 Flock to replace that model for free. You still lose any of its battlekit.
            * Sacrifice. When you Explore, you can spend 3 Flock to gain the Lucky Exploration Skill during that exploration.
            * Seek. When you Explore, you can spend 2 Flock to gain the Seek Exploration Skill during that exploration.

________________


Warband Variant: Ecclesiastic Militant Force
            * Sororitas Support. You can recruit up to 1 Dogmata or 1 Palatine, up to 4 Battle Sisters (max 1 Retributor, 1 Sacrosant, and 1 Zephyrim or Seraphim), and up to 3 Repentia from the Adepta Sororitas Faction. You can also recruit up to 1 Penitent Engine, but you cannot recruit both a Penitent Engine and a Miraculist.


If a piece of battlekit appears in the Adeptus Ministorum Armoury as well as the Adepta Sororitas Armoury, you must obey the highest LIMIT between those Armouries. Models can still only be equipped from their own Armoury unless otherwise stated. You can also purchase Campaign Shop battlekit from the Adepta Sororitas Faction, which can be used by models from that Faction.
            * Fervor. Your Battle Hymns special rule applies to your SORORITAS models. Once during each of their activations, your Palatine models’ Rapturous Blows Ability can be treated as if you discard a Miracle so long as the Palatine is within 3” of a friendly ORATOR model.
            * Decree Passive. You cannot recruit any Crusaders, Death Cult Assassins, or Drill Abbots.
