# Astra Militarum

Astra Militarum Special Rules
Voice of Command. As an Action with a Success Roll with +1 DICE, any of your Elite models can issue an Order to one other non-Elite MILITARUM model within 6” of it. On a success, the chosen model gains the benefits of that Order until the end of the current Turn. A model cannot benefit from the same order more than Once at a time, but can be given multiple different Orders.
            * Duty and Honour! The affected model has +1 INJURY DICE with melee attacks.
            * First Rank, Fire! Second Rank, Fire! The affected model must only spend 3 BLOOD MARKERS to Bloodbath an enemy with a ranged attack, whether the target is Down or not.
            * Fix Bayonets! When an enemy Charges the affected model, the affected model can make a single melee attack against the Charging model.
            * Move! Move! Move! The affected model has +2” movement speed and +1 DICE to all Climb, Dash, Jump, and Diving Charge Success Rolls.
            * Take Aim! The affected model has +1 DICE to Hit with ranged attacks and ignores Long Range penalties.
            * Take Cover! Injury rolls against the affected model have -1 flat, or -2 flat instead if the model is benefiting from cover or a defended obstacle during an attack. This does not count as Armour, but stacks with Armour only up to a total of -3.
