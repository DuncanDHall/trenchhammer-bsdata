Rogue Trader Special Rules
Best of the Best. You can have up to 1 additional Elite model in your Warband for every 500 credits in your Warband. In addition, you can recruit Elite models from among Imperial and Outlaw Factions, as well as from the Aeldari, Drukhari, and Leagues of Votann Factions, with a maximum of 1 model per Faction, or 3 for the Necromunda Gang Faction (but each must be from a different Gang). These models are equipped using their normal Armouries/Battlekit Lists, and you can purchase Campaign Shop battlekit for them from their Faction when allowed. If a piece of battlekit appears in multiple Armouries, you must obey the highest LIMIT among factions whose models you have recruited.


These models gain the ROGUE TRADER Keyword, and their abilities that specify one or more allies with a Faction Keyword apply to your ROGUE TRADER models as well. In addition, for each of them that has the LEADER Keyword, they cost 15 additional credits and lose that Keyword.


You can choose models from Warband Variants, following the rules for that Variant except for any rule that replaces one of the Faction’s normal special rules. The Ynnari Warband Variant of the Aeldari cannot be chosen from.


Your Warband also counts as an Imperial, Outlaw, Xenos (Aeldari), Xenos (Drukhari), and Xenos (Leagues of Votann) Warband for the purpose of recruiting Mercenaries, but not as any specific faction.


Warrant of Trade. Do not keep track of how many credits you have. Instead, you can always afford anything that costs any amount of credits, but you can only have up to 20% more than the credit limit for any given mission worth of models and battlekit at any given time, and can still only bring the normal limit worth to a battle. Any excess must be left in reserves, but you can decide exactly what after learning the mission and your opponent’s Warband.


Example: Your next mission has a Threshold of 1100, so your credit limit is 1100 for that battle. You can purchase up to 1320 (1100 plus 20%, which is 220) credits worth of models and battlekit, but you can bring only 1100 worth of them to the battle.
