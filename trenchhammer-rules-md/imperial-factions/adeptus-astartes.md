# Adeptus Astartes

Adeptus Astartes Special Rules
And They Shall Know No Fear. Your ASTARTES models have NEGATE FEAR.


The Rubicon Primaris. Any of your non-mercenary ASTARTES models besides a Dreadnought can take the following upgrade for a cost of +5 credits, even after they are recruited:
   * Primaris. The model gains +1” movement speed.


In addition, during a campaign, whenever a non-mercenary non-VEHICLE ASTARTES model without the Primaris upgrade is a casualty, or it suffers a Battle Scar, you can immediately attempt to save it by paying 5 credits to upgrade it to Primaris. If you do, roll a D6.
   * On a 4+, the model is upgraded to Primaris and is not considered a casualty, or no Battle Scar is suffered (and no accompanying Trauma).
   * On a 1-3, the model is still a casualty or suffers a Battle Scar as normal. If the Battle Scar does not kill the model, it is still upgraded to Primaris.


Gene Seeds. During a campaign, when one of your ASTARTES models becomes a casualty, you can attempt to recover its Gene Seed. Roll 1D6. On a 4+, or a 3+ if you have an Apothecary in your Warband, add a Gene Seed to your reserves. You can expend a single Gene Seed when you recruit an ASTARTES model to reduce the cost to recruit it by 30 credits.
Adeptus Astartes Patrons
Your patron can be a Chapter Master or The Indomitus Crusade Shared Patron.
Patron: Chapter Master
Or a similar high ranking member of the Adeptus Astartes.
   * Champion Of Humanity. This model has +1 DICE to Hit and +1 INJURY DICE with melee attacks against Elite enemies, but must attack an Elite target when making a melee attack if possible.
   * The Imperium’s Sword. Select any skill you want from the Melee & Strength Skills.
   * Storm Of Fire. Select any skill you want from the Ranged Skills.
No Warband Variant Only:
   * Adept Of The Codex. While this model is on the Battlefield, you cannot fail Morale tests.
   * Master Of Strategy. After you activate this model, you decide the next 3 models to activate, following the normal limits (i.e. the second will usually be your own model again). If you choose a model in a Fireteam, the model's owner decides if it will activate as a Fireteam or individually.
   * Warden of Macragge. When an enemy ends its movement within 6” of this model, this model can immediately make a single ranged attack against that enemy if it is otherwise able to do so.
Black Templars Only:
   * Epitome Of Piety. This model can Deny the Witch as if it had PSYKER 1. If it is already a PSYKER, it has +1 DICE when Denying the Witch.
   * Oathkeeper. If any ally within 1” of this model is hit by a ranged or melee weapon (excluding BLAST weapons), you can choose to redirect the hit to this model instead. Determine the injuries exactly as if the weapon just hit this model.
   * Paragon Of Fury. During an Activation in which it Charged, this model has +1 DICE to Hit and +1 INJURY DICE with melee attacks.
Blood Angels Only:
   * Gift Of Foresight. Once during each battle, you can reroll one Success Roll this model takes, or an injury roll made against it.
   * Heroic Bearing. This model’s Actions, Abilities, Skills, and psychic powers can treat its allies as if they were 3” closer than they are.
   * Soulwarden. The first -1 of armour of this model and each friendly ASTARTES model within 6” of it have IMPERVIOUS.
Dark Angels Only:
   * Honour Of The First Legion. Whenever an enemy model ends its movement within 6” of this model, this model can immediately Charge that enemy.
   * Calibanite Knight. This model scores a Critical Hit with melee attacks on a result of 10 or higher.
   * Stubborn Tenacity. When this model would be taken Out of Action, you can instead treat the result as a Down result. If you do, it is automatically taken Out of Action at the end of the current Turn.
Deathwatch Only
   * Castellan Of The Black Vault. When you choose this skill, you can purchase any battlekit from your Campaign Shop, with its cost reduced by 1 Glory, but any battlekit purchased in this way can be equipped only by this model.
   * Nowhere To Hide. This model’s ranged attacks ignores the STEALTH Keyword, and it can declare a Charge against an enemy it cannot see.
   * The Ties That Bind. This model may form a FIRETEAM with any one non-ELITE model of the Warband. In addition, the first time either model fails a Risky Success Roll during a Fireteam Activation, the Activation does not end.

   * Hand Of Dorn. At the start of each battle, this model gains D3 BLESSING MARKERS.
   * Siege Master. If the target of any of this model’s ranged attack would have an armour modifier of -2 or higher, you may set one die of the injury roll to a 6 before the roll is made. The rest of the dice for the injury roll are rolled as normal.
Iron Hands Only:
   * Adept Of The Omnissiah. As an Action with a Success Roll, this model can attempt to repair itself or a friendly MECHANICUS, ARTIFICIAL, or VEHICLE model within 6” of it. If it succeeds, remove 1 BLOOD MARKER from that model. If this model is a Techmarine, instead its Blessing of the Omnissiah Ability removes D3 BLOOD MARKERS instead of 1.
   * Merciless Logic. This model has +1 DICE to Hit and +1 INJURY DICE enemies that are Down.
   * Student Of History. After this model takes an enemy model Out of Action or knocks it Down, this model can move up to half its movement speed. This movement can allow this model to enter melee combat, but it provides free attacks as if it Retreated if it was in close combat already, except from the enemy that triggered this effect.
Legion of the Damned Only:
   * All-Consuming Flames. This model’s melee attacks gain FIRE.
   * Ethereal Approach. When this model is deployed, normally or via INFILTRATOR or DEEP STRIKE, it becomes invisible, and enemies cannot target it with ranged attacks or Charges. Weapons with the Keyword BLAST it as normal if it is in the radius of the weapon. This effect ends if this model moves from its exact position in any way, it makes a Ranged Attack, or an enemy model comes within 1.5” of it.
   * Undying. You no longer must roll on the Elite Trauma table for this model.
Ravenguard Only:

   * Miraculous Constitution. When this model rolls on the Elite Trauma Chart, roll three times and choose any of the results.
   * Patient And Determined. Once during each of its Activations, instead of rolling to hit with a ranged attack, this model can choose to hit automatically.
Space Wolves Only:
   * Aura Of Majesty. This model’s Actions, Abilities, Skills, and psychic powers can treat its allies as if they were 3” closer than they are.
   * Beastslayer. This model has +1 INJURY DICE enemy models that have the LARGE Keyword.
