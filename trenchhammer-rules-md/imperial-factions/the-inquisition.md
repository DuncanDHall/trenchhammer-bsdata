# The Inquisition

Inquisition Special Rules
Ordo. When creating an Inquisition Warband, you must choose one of the Ordos listed below. You can take the special models and battlekit from that Ordo, and follow any additional special rules it has, but you cannot take any models or battlekit from any of the other Ordos.


If a piece of battlekit appears in the Inquisition Armoury as well as your Chamber Militant’s Armoury, you must obey the highest LIMIT between those Armouries. Models can still only be equipped from their own Armoury unless otherwise stated. You can also purchase Campaign Shop battlekit from your Chamber Militant Faction, which can be used by models from that Faction as well as your INQUISITION models, following all normal limits.


Requisitions. During a campaign, your Warband begins with 11 Glory, but only 500 credits, and your Credit Threshold is always 200 credits lower than normal for any mission. Whenever you Reinforce during the campaign, you also gain 4 Glory. In a one-off game, you instead have 200 fewer credits and 11 more Glory than normal.


Shadow Operations. During a campaign, at the start of each battle, roll a D6 to determine your Shadow Operation for that battle:
               1. Agent Provocateur. Secretly choose one enemy Elite model. At the end of the battle, reveal your choice. If the chosen model was taken Out of Action, you succeed at this Shadow Operation.
               2. Ancient Artefact. At the start of the battle, before deployment, your opponent places a 1” Artefact marker anywhere on the battlefield that is not on Impassable Terrain or completely surrounded by it. As an Action with a Success Roll, any of your models in contact with the marker can attempt to recover that marker. On a success, it is carrying that marker. It can pass the marker to any ally it is within 1” of at the end of any of its Activations. If it is taken Out of Action, a model carrying an Artefact marker drops it at their previous position. At the end of the battle, if one of your models is carrying the Artefact marker, you succeed at this Shadow Operation.
               3. Diabolical Ritual. At the start of the battle, your opponent places 3 1” Ritual markers anywhere on the battlefield outside of deployment zones, at least 6” away from any table edge and from each other marker, and not on Impassable Terrain or completely surrounded by it. As an Action that does not require any roll, any of your models in contact with a Ritual marker can attempt to uncover that marker. Roll to determine if the ritual was uncovered: uncovered on a 5+ on a D6 for the first marker, uncovered on a 4+ on a D6 for the second, automatically uncovered for the third. If the ritual was uncovered, you succeed at this Shadow Operation.
               4. Informant.  At the start of the battle, before deployment, your opponent places a 1” Informant marker anywhere on the battlefield outside of deployment zones, at least 6” away from any table edge, and not on Impassable Terrain or completely surrounded by it. At the end of the battle, if any of your models is in contact with the Informant marker, you succeed at this Shadow Operation.
               5. Sympathiser. At the end of the battle, if you have one or more models in your opponent’s deployment zone, you succeed at this Shadow Operation.
               6. Threat of Uprising. At the end of the battle, if you have more models in your own deployment zone than your opponent, you succeed at this Shadow Operation.


If you succeed at your Shadow Operation, one of your Elite models of your choice gains 1 additional XP.
