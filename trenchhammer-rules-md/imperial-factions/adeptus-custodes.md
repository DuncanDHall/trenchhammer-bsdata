# Adeptus Custodes

Adeptus Custodes Special Rules
Endeavors. During a campaign, when you create your Warband, also begin a new Endeavor. To do so, determine 3 of the following Imperatives at random, in order, rerolling duplicates. You must complete those Imperatives, in the order they were generated, one during each battle.
         * 1: Emperor’s Domain. End the battle with more friendly models than enemy models in your own deployment zone.
         * 2: Wrath of the Emperor. Take at least four enemy models Out of Action before the end of the third Turn during this battle.
         * 3: Make an Example. Win the battle.
         * 4: Vital Targets. Take at least three enemy Elite models Out of Action during this battle. If the enemy has fewer than three Elites, take all of them Out of Action instead.
         * 5: Shadowed Directive. Keep all of your models from being taken Out of Action during the first two Turns of the battle.
         * 6: Absolute Mastery. Score at least two Glorious Deeds during the battle.
         * 7: Shadow of the Throne. At the end of the battle, have more of your models within 12” of the center of the battlefield than there are enemy models.
         * 8: Martial Supremacy. During this battle, take at least two enemy models Out of Action for every one of your own that is taken Out of Action (if none of your models are taken Out of Action, you automatically succeed).
         * 9: Alpha Threat Confirmed. Take the enemy Warband leader Out of Action during the battle.
         * 10: Annihilation. Take every enemy model Out of Action, or win via the enemy failing a Morale Test.
         * 11: Emperor’s Will Be Done. End the battle with more friendly models than enemy models in the enemy’s deployment zone.
         * 12: Inspirational Example. Take at least four enemy models Out of Action with melee attacks during this battle.


If you complete all three of an Endeavor’s Imperatives, you gain an Endeavor Reward and generate a new Endeavor. If you fail to complete an Imperative during a battle, you suffer Dishonor and generate a new Endeavor. You can also choose to abandon an Endeavor and generate a new one if you have completed at least one of its Imperatives, in which case, if you completed two Imperatives, you still receive an Endeavor Reward, chosen at random. If you completed only one, there is no benefit or penalty.


Endeavor Rewards
Choose a Reward from the following options if you completed an Endeavor. Choose a Reward at random instead if you abandoned an Endeavor after completing only two Imperatives.
         * 1. You earn 2 Glory.
         * 2. You roll an additional Promotion die after this and every battle for the rest of the campaign. This benefit stacks.
         * 3. Each of your Elite models gains 1 XP.
         * 4. One of your Elite models gains 2 XP.
         * 5. One of your Elite models gains 1 XP and you earn 1 Glory.
         * 6. Your Warband permanently gains one Exploration Skill of your choice.


Dishonor
Whenever you suffer Dishonor, ignore the next 1 Glory Point you would earn for every incomplete Imperative in the failed Endeavor. This resets rather than stacking if you fail another.
Adeptus Custodes Patrons
Your patron can be the Captain-General, or the Indomitus Crusade Shared Patron.
Patron: Captain-General
Or a similar high ranking member of the Adeptus Custodes.
         * Champion of the Imperium. If any ally within 1” of this model is hit by a ranged or melee weapon (excluding BLAST weapons), you can choose to redirect the hit to this model instead. Determine the injuries exactly as if the weapon just hit this model.
         * Impregnable Mind. This model cannot be forced to move.
         * Master Of Martial Strategy. After you activate this model, you decide the next 3 models to activate, following the normal limits (i.e. the second will usually be your own model again). If you choose a model in a Fireteam, the model's owner decides if it will activate as a Fireteam or individually.
         * Peerless Warrior. This model has +1 INJURY DICE with all attacks.
         * Radiant Mantle. All attacks made against this model have -1 DICE to Hit.
         * Superior Creation (non-Psykana Only). This model has NEGATE FIRE, NEGATE GAS, and NEGATE SHRAPNEL.
