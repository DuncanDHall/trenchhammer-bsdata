# Necromunda Gang

Necromunda Gang Special Rules
Gang. When creating a Necromunda Gang Warband, you must choose one of the gangs listed below. You can take the special models and battlekit from that gang, and follow any additional special rules it has, but you cannot take any models or battlekit from any of the other gangs.


If a piece of battlekit appears in both the Necromunda Gang Shared Armoury and your Gang’s Armoury, use the cost and LIMIT from your Gang’s Armoury.


Fast Learners. You roll an additional Promotion Die at the end of each battle. In addition, when one of your models is promoted to Elite, it immediately gains a Campaign Skill. Choose one of the available Skill Charts and roll 2D6 on it. Reroll results of 2 or 12. The model has that skill in addition to any it learns via XP.
Necromunda Gang Patrons
Your patron can be a Gang Overlord. If your Warband is an Imperium Warband, your patron can be a Wealthy Noble. If your Warband is an Outlaw Warband, your patron can be a Sump Lord.
Patron: Gang Overlord
                     * Crushing Blow. When this model Downs an enemy with a melee attack (even if it is already Down), that enemy suffers an additional STUN MARKER.
                     * Gang Territory. This model gains the Set Dice Exploration Skill.
                     * Overpower. Select any skill you want from the Melee & Strength Skills.
                     * Mighty Leap. This model automatically succeeds when it takes the Jump Success Roll.
                     * Fearsome. This model gains the FEAR Keyword.
                     * True Grit. Injury rolls made against this model as a result of falling, Dangerous Terrain, or non-attack Abilities or psychic powers have -2 DICE.
Patron: Sump Lord
                     * Catfall. This model does not suffer Injury rolls as a result of falling, and it does not fall Down or suffer an Injury roll due to failing a Diving Charge.
                     * Down and Dirty. This model ignores the penalties to Success Roll rolls from being Down. Additionally, this model gains +1 DICE to Hit and Injure Down enemy models with Melee Attacks.
                     * In the Shadows. Select any skill you want from the Stealth & Speed Skills.
                     * Iron Jaw. Injury rolls made against this model as a result of melee attacks have -1 DICE.
                     * Lie Low. While this model is in cover against such an attack, enemies cannot make ranged attacks at Long Range against it (even if the attack normally ignores Cover or Long Range, or hits automatically).
                     * Tunnel Rat. This model gains the Seek and Circle Back Exploration skills.
Patron: Wealthy Noble
                     * Counter Attack. When an enemy makes a melee attack against this model, this model can make a melee attack against that enemy afterwards, if it is not taken Out of Action. It can do so only once during each model’s Activation.
                     * Expedition Funding. This model gains the Extra Dice Exploration Skill twice.
                     * Firearm Procurement (LIMIT: 1). The cost of any ranged weapon worth 20 ducats or more is reduced by 5 ducats if the model with this skill is part of the Warband. Note that weapons bought with this lower cost make it easier for you to fit under the Threshold value.
                     * Hotshot. Select any skill you want from the Ranged Skills.
                     * Inspirational. This model and its allies within 6” have the NEGATE FEAR Keyword.
                     * Team Work. This model may form a FIRETEAM with any one non-ELITE model of the Warband. In addition, the first time either model fails a Risky Success Roll during a Fireteam Activation, the Activation does not end.

Necromunda Gang Unique Battlekit
Necromunda Gang Equipment
                     * Caryatid. Once per battle, when the owner is hit by an attack, you can force the attacker to reroll that attack at -2 DICE.
                     * Ridgerunner. The equipped model is mounted on a bike. The rider gains the LARGE Keyword if it is not already LARGE, as well as the VEHICLE Keyword, a movement speed of 10”/Infantry, but has only one hand to carry other weapons, though it can hold two-handed weapons with Shield Combo. It also has the Outrider abilities.
                     * Outrider. The rider has +1 DICE to all Dash Success Rolls, but it cannot climb sheer surfaces.
Necromunda Gang Chem Equipment
A model can equip only one Chem Equipment at a time.
                     * Frenzon. The model has +1 DICE to Hit in melee, but at the start of each Activation, if there are any enemy models within 12” that it can see, its first action must be to Charge the closest enemy.
                     * Ghast. At the start of the battle, roll for a random Shared Psychic Discipline (or a random House Delaque Psychic Discipline if your gang is House Delaque), and two different random Powers from that Discipline. The model gains those powers and the PSYKER 1 Keyword until the end of the battle, but its psychic powers have PERILOUS ±2.
                     * ‘Slaught. The model gains +1 INJURY DICE in melee. If a model has ever been equipped with this Chem Equipment and is not equipped with it during a battle, add +1 DICE to Injury rolls against that model.
                     * Spur. The model gains +1” movement speed. At the end of each of the model’s Activations, it must make a Success Roll. On a failure, the Spur has worn off and ceases to function.
                     * Stinger Mould. The model can ignore the effects of one Trauma it has suffered for the duration of the battle.
Necromunda Gang Campaign Shop
During a campaign, these pieces of battlekit are available only when your Warband is specifically allowed to purchase them.


Hangers On. Hangers on function just like equipment. You can use a model to represent them, but you do not need to. A model can be equipped with only up to 1 hanger on at a time. A hanger on must be equipped to a model fielded during a battle in order to use any of its pre- or post-battle effects.
                     * Agitator (2 Glory, LIMIT: 1, Outlaw Only). Once per battle, the equipped model or an ally within 12” of it can reroll a Dash Success Roll. In addition, at the start of the battle, you can boast that you are going to win. If you win the battle, you gain 1 Glory. If you lose the battle, you gain 1 fewer Glory from that battle, if you gained any. On a tie, nothing happens.
                     * Ammo-Jack (2 Glory, LIMIT: 3). Once per battle, the equipped model can reroll one ranged attack Success Roll it makes.
                     * Cadaver Merchant (1 Glory, LIMIT: 1, Outlaw Only). Once per battle, you can give the equipped model FEAR when it is attacked in melee. This keyword lasts until the end of the current Turn. In addition, at the end of each battle, you earn 10 credits for every model that was a casualty, on either side, during that battle.
                     * Chem Dealer (1 Glory, LIMIT: 1). Once during each battle, the equipped model can gain the effects of one chem equipment from the Necromunda Gang Armoury for one entire Activation. If you choose ‘Slaught, the drawback applies only during this battle. In addition, one chem equipment equipped by the same model loses CONSUMABLE while both remain equipped.
                     * Data-Skrivener (2 Glory, LIMIT: 1). Once during each battle, the equipped model can gain +1 DICE on any one Success Roll that is not an attack or Dash Success Roll. In addition, you have the Lucky Exploration Skill.
                     * Dome Runner (2 Glory, LIMIT: 1). Once during each battle, when a ranged attack misses it, the equipped model can take a Standard Move or Retreat Action, but can move only up to 3”. In addition, you have the Seek Exploration Skill.
                     * Fixer (2 Glory, LIMIT: 1, Imperial Only). Once during each battle, when this model falls Down, it can immediately stand up again. In addition, you have the Circle Back Exploration Skill.
                     * Gang Lookout (2 Glory, LIMIT: 1). Once during each battle, if your opponent would activate the first model during a Turn, you can activate this model first. In addition, you have the Reroll Exploration Skill.
                     * Heretek (2 Glory, LIMIT: 1, Outlaw Only). Once during each Battle, the equipped model can add the GAS, FIRE, or SHRAPNEL Keyword to one attack it hits with.
                     * ’Narker (1 Glory, LIMIT: 2). One per battle, you can set the result of one Charge roll made against this model to 1. In addition, you have the Reroll Exploration skill.
                     * Propagandist (2 Glory, LIMIT: 1). Once per battle, you can gain +1 DICE to a Morale roll. In addition, at the end of each battle, roll a D6. On a 5-6, you gain 1 Glory.
                     * Proxy (2 Glory, LIMIT: 1, Outlaw Only). Once during each battle, when this model falls Down, it can immediately stand up again. In addition, you have the Duplicate Exploration Skill.
                     * Rogue Doc (2 Glory, LIMIT: 2). Once per battle, during its Activation, you can remove 1 BLOOD MARKER from the equipped model.
                     * Slopper (1 Glory, LIMIT: 1). At the end of the battle, you can reroll one Casualty or Elite Taruma roll (for any model in your Warband).
                     * Underhive Trader (1 Glory, LIMIT: 1). You have the Extra Dice Exploration Skill.
