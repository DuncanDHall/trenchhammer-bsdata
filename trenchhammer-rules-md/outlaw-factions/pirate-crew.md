Pirate Crew Special Rules
Backgrounds. Whenever you recruit a PIRATE model, choose one of the following Backgrounds for it, paying the additional cost if any:
                     * Beastman (+0 credits). When the Beastman successfully Charges one or more enemies, give one of those enemies a BLOOD MARKER. The Beastman gains the BEASTMEN Keyword.
                     * Dark Eldar (+5 credits). The Dark Eldar has +1” movement speed. It can spend 1 BLOOD MARKER from among non-ARTIFICIAL enemy models to gain +1 DICE to a Hit with any one attack or +1 DICE to Dash. Limit once per Success Roll. The Dark Eldar can take battlekit from the Drukhari Battlekit list in addition to the Pirate Crew Armoury. It can use Incubus or Wych Only battlekit. The Dark Eldar gains the DRUKHARI Keyword.
                     * Death Worlder (+0 credits). The Death Worlder has NEGATE FIRE and NEGATE GAS.
                     * Eldar Corsair (+5 credits). The Eldar Corsair has +1” movement speed, and +1 DICE to all Dash Success Rolls. It can take battlekit from the Aeldari Battlekit list in addition to the Pirate Crew Armoury, but limited by the Limited Arsenal special rule of the Corsairs Warband Variant. The Eldar Corsair gains the AELDARI Keyword.
                     * Feral Worlder (+0 credits). The Feral Worlder gains the STEALTH Keyword, it Ignores Difficult Terrain, and it has +1 DICE to all Climb Success Rolls.
                     * Forge Worlder (+0 credits). The first Down result the Forge Worlder suffers each battle is ignored. (Does not apply to the TOUGH Keyword.)
                     * Gretchin Freebooter (-5 credits). The Gretchin Freebooter has +1 Ranged Skill, -1 Melee Skill, and the ORK and STEALTH Keywords. The Gretchin Freebooter cannot carry any HEAVY battlekit, and Charging is always a Risky Success Roll for it. If it gains the STRONG Keyword, the two cancel out. It can also take Grot Blastas, melee weapons, armour, and equipment from the Ork Battlekit list in addition to the Pirate Crew Armoury. It gains the ORK Keyword.
                     * Hive Worlder (+0 credits). Friendly models ignore the Hive Worlder when making ranged attacks against enemies it is in melee with.
                     * Kroot (+5 credits). The Kroot has +1 DICE to all Dash Success Rolls and the STEALTH Keyword. It can take Kroot Only battlekit from the T’au Empire Battlekit list in addition to the Pirate Crew Armoury. The Kroot gains the KROOT Keyword.
                     * Kin (+0 credits). The Kin has -1” movement speed, but improves the modifier of any Armour it wears by -1. This does not stack with shields, and the Kin must wear armour to benefit. The Kin can take battlekit from the Leagues of Votann Battlekit list in addition to the Pirate Crew Armoury. It gains the VOTANN Keyword.
                     * Noble (+0 credits). Other friendly models have +1 DICE to Hit with melee attacks against targets the Noble is also in melee with. This effect does not stack.
                     * Ogryn (+35 credits, or +5 for Pirate Captain). The Ogryn gains the LARGE, LIMITED POTENTIAL, STRONG, and TOUGH Keywords.
                     * Ork Freebooter (+0 credits). The Ork Freebooter has +1 Melee Skill and -1 Ranged Skill. It can take battlekit from the Ork Battlekit list in addition to the Pirate Crew Armoury. It can use Kommando-only, Mek-only, and Stormboy-only battlekit. The Ork Freebooter gains the ORK Keyword.
                     * Piscean (+0 credits). The Piscean has the SKIRMISHER Keyword and ignores all penalties to its attack Success Rolls besides Cover, Long Range, and BLOOD MARKERS (including INFECTION and STUN), as well as penalties or limits to the range of its ranged weapons.
                     * Ratling (+0 credits). The Ratling has +1 Ranged Skill, -1 Melee Skill, the SKIRMISHER Keyword, and +1 DICE to all Climb Success Rolls. It cannot carry any HEAVY battlekit. If it gains the STRONG Keyword, the two cancel out.
                     * Slanni Brave (-5 credits). The Slanni Brave has VICIOUS 11 with melee attacks against a target with 1 or more BLOOD MARKERS. It also gains the SLANN Keyword. It can take battlekit from the Slanni Battlekit list in addition to the Pirate Crew Armoury.
                     * Slanni Brute (+20 credits). When the Slanni Brute makes a melee attack with a HEAVY melee weapon, it can target two enemy models it is in melee combat with. The attack’s Success Roll is made only once, hitting both on a success. It also gains the LARGE, SLANN, and STRONG Keywords, +1 Melee Skill, and Injury rolls made against it have -1, stacking with Armour up to -3. It can take battlekit from the Slanni Battlekit list in addition to the Pirate Crew Armoury.
                     * Slanni Skirmisher (-5 credits). The Slanni Skirmisher has +2 DICE to Climb and Jump Success Rolls, and it never suffers injury rolls from falling. It also has +1 DICE to Diving Charge Success Rolls and does not fall Down or suffer an Injury roll due to failing a Diving Charge. The Slanni Skirmisher gains the SKIRMISHER and SLANN Keywords and has -1 Melee Skill. It can take battlekit from the Slanni Battlekit list in addition to the Pirate Crew Armoury, and counts as a Skirmisher for that purpose.
                     * Tarellian (+0 credits). The Tarellian has +2” movement speed.
                     * Voidborn (+0 credits). The Voidborn begins each battle with a BLESSING MARKER.
                     * Zoat (+40 credits). The Zoat gains the FEAR and LARGE Keywords. It cannot wear non-shield armour, but it has armoured scales that provide it with -2 Armour.


If any of your models can take battlekit from another Armoury, you must obey the highest LIMIT among armories a model has access to for each piece of battlekit.


Specialties. Whenever you recruit a PIRATE model, you may optionally choose one of the following Specialties for it, paying the additional cost:
                     * Cannoneer (+15 credits, LIMIT: 1). When the Cannoneer makes a ranged attack with a TWO-HANDED weapon during its Activation, it has +1 INJURY DICE. This applies only to the first attack if it can attack multiple times in one Activation.
                     * Duelist (+10 credits, LIMIT: 2). Whenever an enemy Charges the Duelist, the Duelist can make a single melee attack with a non-HEAVY weapon against that enemy before it takes any further actions.

                     * Pistoleer (+10 credits, LIMIT: 2). The Pistoleer has the following benefits while armed with Ranged Weapons with the PISTOL Keyword:
                     * If it is equipped with 2 Weapons with the PISTOL Keyword, it can take a Shoot ACTION with one and then immediately take a Shoot ACTION with the other.
                     * Add the ASSAULT and IGNORE OFF-HAND WEAPON Keywords to any weapons that have the PISTOL Keyword.

The Psyker may purchase up to three powers from that Discipline. It can only use Psychic Powers while wielding a PSYCHIC weapon. This Specialty is modified in the following ways, depending on the model’s Keywords:
                     * AELDARI: Must choose Runes of Battle, Runes of Fate, or Runes of Fortune instead of a Share Discipline.
                     * ORK Must choose powers from the Ork Psychic Powers list described in the Orks faction instead of a discipline.

Black Market Acquisitions. You can purchase battlekit from the Campaign Shop without needing permission from Exploration or other rules to do so, so long as its cost is at most an amount of Glory equal to the number of battles you have already fought (or 3 for a one-off battle). In addition, you can purchase battlekit from the Campaign Shop of any other Faction besides Chaos Daemons, Orks (except for ORK models), Necrons, and Tyranids.

Warband Variant: Chaos Pirates
                     * Chaos Aligned. Your Warband counts as a Chaos Warband instead of an Outlaw Warband. Your Patron can optionally be the Chaos Warlord or Heretek Lord Shared Patron.
                     * Chaotic Backgrounds. You cannot select the Dark Eldar, Eldar Corsair, Gretchin Freebooter, Ork Freebooter, Slanni Brave, Slanni Brute, or Slanni Skirmisher Backgrounds, but you can select the following new Backgrounds in addition to the others that are available:
                     * Bloodgor (+5 credits). The Bloodgor has +1 Melee Skill and rolls 2D6 instead of 1D6 to determine Charge distance, taking the highest result. It gains the BEASTMEN and KHORNE Keywords.
                     * Fellgor (+5 credits). The Fellgor has +1 Melee Skill and when it is taken Out of Action, before removing it from the table, it can make a single melee attack against an enemy it is in close combat with. BLOOD MARKERS cannot be spent on this attack's Success Roll.  It gains the BEASTMEN Keyword.
                     * Pestigor (+5 credits). The Pestigor has +1 Melee Skill and treats Down results as Minor Hits (does not affect Down results that replace Out of Action via TOUGH Keyword), but has -1” movement speed. It gains the BEASTMEN and NURGLE Keywords.
                     * Skaven (-5 credits). Enemies do not get to make a free attack when the Skaven Retreats. It gains the SKAVEN Keyword, and can take battlekit from the Vermintide Armoury in addition to the Pirate Crew Armoury. A Skaven with the Psyker Specialty must choose the Ruin Psychic Discipline instead of a Shared Psychic Discipline.
                     * Slaangor (+5 credits). The Slaangor has +1 Melee Skill and the first time during each Turn that it suffers any BLOOD MARKERS, if it is not Down, it can move up to 3”, and can move into or out of melee in this way, treating it as a Retreat or Charge as appropriate. It gains the BEASTMEN and SLAANESH Keywords.
                     * Tzaangor (+5 credits). The Slaangor has +1 Melee Skill, +1 Ranged Skill, and the BEASTMEN, SKIRMISHER, and TZEENTCH Keywords.
                     * Chaotic Specialties. You can choose any of the following Specialties in addition to those normally available.
                     * Fluxbray (+10 credits, LIMIT: 1, Beastmen Only). The model gains an extra arm, which can carry melee weapons as normal. It can make an additional attack with any weapon in that arm without off-hand penalties.
                     * Herder (+5 credits, LIMIT: 1). Other BEASTMEN allies within 3” of the Herder have VICIOUS 10 with all melee attacks.
